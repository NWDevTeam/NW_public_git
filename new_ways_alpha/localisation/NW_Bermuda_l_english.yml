    ### EVENTS ###
    bermuda.1.t:0 "Segregation in the Military"
    bermuda.1.d:0 "For a long time, the armed forces of Bermuda were in a deplorable state due to the reduction of military subsidies and the negligence of officers sent from the mother country. The recent withdrawal of regular British land forces from Bermuda in 1934 will allow us to solve one of the problems, namely, to form a corps of officers from native Bermudians who are familiar with local conditions and can provide the island's defense in the event of a potential war. First of all, these are West Indian Blacks who were born in Bermuda and make up almost the entire rank and file of our armed forces. The gradual elevation of the status of West Indian Blacks in the army will also normalize the relationship of power with the black majority of the population of Bermuda."

    bermuda.2.d:0 "In 1934, regular land units of the British army were withdrawn from Bermuda, leaving the defense of Bermuda to local volunteer units under the command of British officers. After the incident in 1936, many officers in Bermuda were demoted, which caused the Governor-General of Bermuda to begin recruiting soldiers from the local population into the officer corps. Among them was a large number of so-called «West Indian Blacks» - descendants of Blacks slaves born in Bermuda. Such rash decisions, not agreed with London, may present some inconvenience to our colonial armed forces, where Blacks make up a large part of the rank and file. On the other hand, the Bermuda experience can become the basis for further reform of the Empire, and even if not, where are these Bermuda Islands, at what end of the world are they located?"

    bermuda.123.d:0 "The landing was successful. The local garrison did not resist, part of it went to our side. Another victory for Bermuda!"
    bermuda.123.a:0 "Wowee"
    
    bermuda.124.t:0 "Invasion Was Repulsed"
    bermuda.124.d:0 "Landing failed. Our troops were defeated by the local garrison. We've suffered a temporary defeat, and we can still try to fix it."
    bermuda.124.a:0 "Alas"
    
    bermuda.125.t:0 "Bermuda Declares Independence"
    bermuda.125.d:0 "After our forced departure from the British Isles, the position of the Royal Government was severely shaken. Bermuda's business circles and local militants declared independence for their islands, but did not refuse to continue the war on our side. In any case, we already have too many problems to respond to."
    bermuda.125.a:0 "Now we can't do anything"
    
    bermuda.126.t:0 "Bermuda Congress"
    bermuda.126.d:0 "After independence, the question of the political system of Bermuda is raised. For this, the Bermuda Congress was to be convened with delegates from all groups. Three major parties have already been formed: the United Bermuda Party, representing the former colonial administration and the Democrats; the Labour Party, a Soviet-oriented party expressing the interests of the majority of the dispossessed black population; and the Non-Partisan Bloc, consisting of military and volunteers, seeking to isolate Bermuda from the World War II."
    bermuda.126.a:0 "It's about time"
    
    bermuda.127.t:0 "Question 1 - Form of the Government"
    bermuda.127.d:0 "With the proclamation of Bermuda as a republic, the question of the role of parliament in it arises. The experience of parliamentary democracy in Britain and other German-occupied countries is known to us, but it is still insisted on by most of the United and Labour Party delegates. In their next, non-partisan delegates from the army propose to establish the post of president - the actual head of state, which is outside the system of 3 branches of power and controls them."
    bermuda.127.a:0 "Presidential"
    bermuda.127.b:0 "Parliamentary"
    
    bermuda.128.t:0 "Question 2 - Head of the State"
    bermuda.128.d:0 "The choice of the Head of State will determine the future course of Bermuda's development. Congress delegates presented three candidates. Sir Henry Tucker is the head of the Bank of Bermuda and the de facto head of Bermuda since independence. He has great influence in business circles in the United States and Canada, which in turn will help strengthen our international position. The second candidate, Sir Thomas Dill, is the Attorney General of the Islands who led the armed forces after independence. He has great influence in the military but does not want to drag Bermuda into war. The third hero, Russell Dismont, is a lawyer and head of the newly formed Labour Party of Bermuda. He is a West Indian Negro, and is very popular with half the island's black population. Your choice?"
    bermuda.128.a:0 "Sir Henry Tucker is the head of the Bank of Bermuda, liberal"
    bermuda.128.b:0 "Sir Thomas Dill is a prosecutor, a pragmatist" 
    bermuda.128.c:0 "Russell Dismont - black lawyer, Labour" 
    
    bermuda.129.t:0 "Question 3 - Racial Question"
    bermuda.129.d:0 "Half the population of Bermuda is a West Indian Negro, with limited political and civil rights. By equalizing their rights with those of the whites, we will surely secure tremendous popular support. But isn't it too early for such a revolutionary transformation?"
    bermuda.129.a:0 "All are equal!"
    bermuda.129.b:0 "Too risky"
    
    bermuda.130.t:0 "Question 4 - Economic Policy"
    bermuda.130.d:0 "During the colonial era, all those small businesses on the island were owned and operated by the colonial government. Now the question before us is: nationalize them and maintain state control or sell them all to private owners?"
    bermuda.130.a:0 "Keep state control"
    bermuda.130.b:0 "The start of privatization"
    
    bermuda.131.t:0 "Question 5 - What are we Fighting for?"
    bermuda.131.d:0 "After independence, we are no longer allied with the UK and the question arises of Bermuda's continued involvement in the war with Germany. The business community and the former colonial administration insist on a new alliance treaty with Britain for the sake of military contracts, as our chances of defending ourselves against Germany are highly questionable. The military proposes to get out of the war and declare international neutrality, focusing on solving the island's internal problems. This is partly due to the fact that the few Bermudian volunteers who have returned from Europe are not telling the most pleasant moments of the war.Finally, Labour offers to establish diplomatic relations with the USSR, which is also fighting the war with Germany."
    bermuda.131.a:0 "Keep old connections"
    bermuda.131.b:0 "Declare Neutrality"
    bermuda.131.c:0 "Start a diplomatic relationship with the USSR"
    
    bermuda.132.t:0 "Summing up"
    bermuda.132.d:0 "So, Congress has finished its work. The last meeting is being held, after which the fate of the country will be announced."
    bermuda.132.a:0 "It's about time"
    
    bermuda.133.t:0 "Congressional Outcome"
    bermuda.133.d:0 "So, the last session of Congress has come to an end, and it is already possible to name the party which has won the majority of seats in the new parliament of the country. It will determine the future vector of the country's domestic and foreign policy."
    bermuda.133.a:0 "United Party Victory"
    bermuda.133.b:0 "The victory of the non-partisan block"
    bermuda.133.c:0 "Labour's Winning"
    
    bermuda.134.t:0 "Evacuation of Gold Reserve"
    bermuda.134.d:0 "The metropolis is suffering more and more defeats in Europe, which raises the issue of pre-extraction of the gold reserve to the overseas colonies. We could suggest Britain begin evacuating the gold stock to Canada through our islands in exchange for a small portion of the gold to remain in Bermuda."
    bermuda.134.a:0 "Make an offer"
    bermuda.134.b:0 "It doesn't make sense"

    bermuda.135.t:0 "Tighten Their Belts"
    bermuda.135.d:0 "Tighten Belts" is the period in the history of Bermuda in 1920-30, when Britain withdrew regular ground troops from Bermuda and completely abolished military subsidies. Thus, of all the Bermuda's many coastal artillery batteries, only 2 cannons operated on St. David's Island, served by volunteers."
    bermuda.135.a:0 "The squeaky wheel that gets the grease"
