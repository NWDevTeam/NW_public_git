 BRW_formation_of_national_guard_in_rwanda_desc: "With the fall of the colonial regime in the Congo, our territory was left defenseless, as our country was forbidden by the rules of the mandate to create local armed forces, while the Congolese "Force Publique" defended our country.

 BRW_formation_of_national_guard_in_urundi_desc: "With the fall of the colonial regime in the Congo, our territory was left defenseless, as our country was forbidden by the rules of the mandate to create local armed forces, while the Congolese "Force Publique" defended our country. It is necessary to form a territorial army in Urundi to ensure security in the region, as the successful example of anti-colonialism can be extended to our lands."
 BRW_porters_at_the_front: "Stretcher Bearers at the Front"
 BRW_porters_at_the_front_desc: "The prohibition imposed by the League of Nations against recruiting native peoples in mandate territory is still in force. Therefore, the population can be used as an auxiliary force at the front to help our metropolis."
 BRW_cheap_goods_for_metropolis: "Cheap Goods for the Metropole"
 BRW_cheap_goods_for_metropolis_desc: "The Belgian government, with the beginning of the war, needed cheap resources, hence the increased exploitation of resources from the colonies. By minimizing food prices, we will help our metropolis and ensure our contribution to the war to keep us safe."

 BRW_lift_the_ban_on_recruiting_desc: "The ban imposed by the League of Nations on the recruitment of native peoples in mandate territory is still in place. But we can go against the agreements of the League of Nations, which is already on the verge of collapse, unable to face the world threat.

 BRW_colonization_of_the_mind: "Colonization of the Mind"
 BRW_colonization_of_the_mind_desc: "The 1926 local government reform streamlined and revised the powers of chiefs. More importantly, the reform eliminated the traditional balance of power that existed between Tutsi and Hutu chiefs. It canceled the traditional trinity of three chiefs (the pastoral chief was always a Tutsi, the land chief was quite often a Hutu, and the people chief was usually a Tutsi) and placed power in the hands of one powerful Tutsi. In general, colonialism brought "a deep-rooted subjugation and reprogramming of the natives - what might be called the colonization of the mind."
 BRW_tribunals_with_a_single_chief: "Tribunals with a Unified Leader"
 BRW_tribunals_with_a_single_chief_desc: "The reforms to impose Tutsi power over the Hutu must be brought to a final conclusion, the reform of the judiciary. Henceforth the head of the court would be the mwami or abami himself. The territorial court would consist of a judge and an even number of assessors chosen by the king from among the chiefs. For the judge and for each assessor, the king shall appoint one or two deputies chosen from among the nobles. The judge, assessors and their deputies must be proposed by the territorial administrator and approved by the resident. The jurisdiction of these courts applies only to disputes between native peoples. Failure to comply with court decisions would result in a penalty of one month's imprisonment, a maximum of 100 almond francs or eight lashes."
 BRW_preservation_of_the_two_tier_education_system: "Preserve the Two-Tier Education System"
 BRW_preservation_of_the_two_tier_education_system_desc: "By the early 1930s, the public schools were closed and the missions took over the education system. The system they created was two-tiered. There was a tendency to limit admission to mainly Hutus, especially in the upper grades. But where both Tutsi and Hutu children were admitted, there was a clear differentiation in the education intended for each. Tutsis received a "higher" education, taught in French in a separate stream. Assimilationist education prepared them for administrative positions in government and showed their preparation for citizenship, even if at the lowest level. In contrast, the Hutus received an education considered "secondary" because they were taught in another stream in which Swahili was the language of education. The point of separatist education was not only to prepare them for physical labor, but also to emphasize the political fact that educated Hutus were not destined for common citizenship."
 BRW_open_government_schools: "Open Government Schools"
 BRW_open_government_schools_desc: "The two-tier education system has created ethnic conflicts that have divided our nation. Of course this was legitimated by colonial policy in our mandate, but placing all education under the jurisdiction of the Catholic Church and the White Fathers has resulted in the Hutus not being able to enter the sciences and become productive citizens. Government schools, general education, must be reopened."
 BRW_evolue: "Évolué"
 BRW_evolue_desc: "Évolué is a French term used to describe a native African who has "evolved" by becoming Europeanized through education or assimilation and adopting European values and behaviors. It is most often used to refer to people in the Belgian and French colonial empires. Evoletes spoke French, followed European (rather than local) laws, usually holds positions of officialdom (although they were rarely above clerks) and lives mostly in the urban areas of the colony. In our colony, such Évolué are the European-educated Tutsis."
 BRW_Nyakibanda_Grand_Seminary: "Nyakibanda Major Seminary"
 BRW_Nyakibanda_Grand_Seminary_desc: "The seminary is under the jurisdiction of the Episcopal Conference of Rwanda, who in turn are under the Holy See in Rome, which is represented by the Congregation for the Evangelization of Peoples. It is located in the Gishamvu sector of Huye district in the Southern province of Rwanda, below the mountain range called Ibisi baya Nyakibanda. It is about 12 kilometers (7.5 miles) from Butare."
 BRW_rwanda_urundi_sanitary_network: "Rwanda-Urundi Sanitary Network"
 BRW_rwanda_urundi_sanitary_network_desc: "In the 1930s, an extensive sanitary network program was launched that involved a medical census of the entire population over a five-year period. Every Rwandan and every Burundian had to be medically examined at least three times, treated if necessary, and agree to isolation or treatment in sick camps or hospitals. Draconian rules provided for punishment of the unruly, as well as their families, neighbors, and local chiefs if they failed to report them to administrative and health authorities. The punishment could be up to one year of hard labor and a fine of two thousand francs, a large sum for the time."
 BRW_campaign_against_yaws: "The Campaign Against Yaws"
 BRW_campaign_against_yaws_desc: "The most widespread disease in our territories is Yaws. It is worthwhile to conduct a vaccination campaign against this disease, as it causes a decrease in productivity and extinction of our population."
 BRW_sanitary_agreement_with_british_colonies: "Sanitary Agreement with the British Colonies"
 BRW_sanitary_agreement_with_british_colonies_desc: "The Buganda and Tanganyika peoples close to our population also suffer from tropical diseases, by signing a sanitary agreement we will improve the general level of medicine in our states."
 BRW_increase_mwami_council: "Increase the Number of Members of the Mwami Council"
 BRW_increase_mwami_council_desc: "The Mwami Council has a very important function in helping the Mwami of Urundi and the Aba of Rwanda to govern the country. By increasing the number of its members, our dependence on the metropolis will increase, and in return, the administrative apparatus throughout the territory will be improved."
 BRW_establishment_of_constituencies: "Create Electoral Districts"
 BRW_establishment_of_constituencies_desc: "The main task of our mandate is to prepare the territories for self-determination and independence. Constituencies should be created, for the future."
 BRW_erosion_control_ditches: "Erosion Control Ditches"
 BRW_erosion_control_ditches_desc: "The heavy topography of the territory forces the administration to build erosion control ditches. Before that, people crossed kilometers of mountainous terrain to prevent erosion."
 BRW_abbreviation_corvee: "Reduce Corvee"
 BRW_abbreviation_corvee_desc: "Brutal exploitation should not concern those who work for the good of the state, therefore, exemption from corvee should be allowed to certain classes of the population, in compensation they would be obliged to pay in return."
 BRW_mwami_return_to_the_apparatus: "Mwami's Return to the State Apparatus"
 BRW_mwami_return_to_the_apparatus_desc: "After Mwami Urundi Mwambutsa IV has graduated from educational institutions and is now ready to rule the country, it is worth returning him to the territorial apparatus by assigning him new powers."
 BRW_rule_of_ganwa: "The power of Ganwa"
 BRW_rule_of_ganwa_desc: "In Urundi, Hutu and Tutsi are united by a common allegiance and support for the monarchy. Members of the ganwa aristocracy serve as provincial governors, governing various parts of Urundi on behalf of the king. Political competition occurred between the princely clans that together made up the ganwa, and challengers to monarchical power drew on both Tutsi and Hutu. Partly as a consequence of this historical pattern, in colonial politics we rely more on solidarity and division within the clan system than on the Tutsi/Hutu distinction. Rwanda, by contrast, has focused on the Tutsi/Hutu divide, increased the authority and power of the Tutsi, and managed them effectively."
 BRW_removal_of_chiefs: "To Depose the Leaders"
 BRW_removal_of_chiefs_desc: "Chieftains of local kingdoms who are disloyal to the administration are causing problems for our policy. Mwambutsa himself is not satisfied with them, so we will have him reappoint them."
 BRW_support_bezi: "Support Bezi"
 BRW_support_bezi_desc: "The Ganwa oligarchy is divided into the descendants of Mwezi Gisabo (Bezi) and the descendants of Ntare Rugamba (Batare). The Bezi are more conservative and attached to their lineage and ancestral heritage. The Batare, on the other hand, are more Europeanized, speaking French and practicing Christianity. The administration has long emphasized support for the Bezi, which includes King Mwambutsa, in order to keep the population loyal."
 BRW_liquidation_of_muramvya_autonomy: "Eliminate Autonomy Myravja"
 BRW_liquidation_of_muramvya_autonomy_desc: "From ancient times, Muravja was the central chiefdom, the former capital, where the great Ntare IV ruled a federal monarchy. Nowadays it is a principality with an autocratic chief who is not respected by the people and is not regarded as their umwami. It is worth handing it over to be ruled by the umwami personally to assert historical dominance."
 BRW_bias_towards_batare: "Bias towards Batare"
 BRW_bias_towards_batare_desc: "The Ganwa oligarchy is divided into the descendants of Mwezi Gisabo (Bezi) and the descendants of Ntare Rugamba (Batare). The Bezi are more conservative and attached to their lineage and ancestral heritage. The Batare, on the other hand, are more Europeanized, speaking French and practicing Christianity. Clearly, it is worth relying on the more educated members of the ruling elite."
 BRW_deal_with_the_hutu_chiefs: "To Eliminate the Hutu-Leaders"
 BRW_deal_with_the_hutu_chiefs_desc: "A small number of wild Hutu chiefdoms still exist within the borders of Urundi. It is worth ending their autocratic behavior, even though they often manage their lands better than the Tutsis."
 BRW_strengthen_power_in_the_region: "Strengthen the Power in the Region"
 BRW_strengthen_power_in_the_region_desc: "Opposition from some chiefs threatens the loyalty of the monarch. By eliminating it and placing chiefs loyal to the mandate administration, the Mwami will consolidate its supremacy in Urundi."
 BRW_appointment_of_treasury_funds: "Designate Treasury Funds"
 BRW_appointment_of_treasury_funds_desc: "Taxes are more than half of our county's income, so it's worth improving the county's tax system by creating local treasury funds."
 BRW_urbanization_in_defiance_of_peasants: "Urbanization Against the Peasants"
 BRW_urbanization_in_defiance_of_peasants_desc: "As we modernize our state, it is worthwhile to expand urbanized areas, eliminating farming, on lands that will become urban."
 BRW_divide_et_impera: "Divide and Rule"
 BRW_divide_et_impera_desc: "The policy in the Rwandan kingdom is different from that in Urundi, Tutsi supremacy is consolidated to the maximum extent, but at the same time power is retained for the most part by local chiefs. Also, in order to "educate" the natives, it was decided to Christianize the region rigidly. This is why King Yuhi V was deposed for his unChristian selfishness and lust."
 BRW_liquidation_of_bushira_autonomy: "Eliminate the Autonomy of Bouchira"
 BRW_liquidation_of_bushira_autonomy_desc: "The blind chief of Bushira, Nyamakwa III, has to rely on his sons for power. Although he wished for the independence of his people, for which he was granted autonomy in 1925, in Rwanda, he cannot rule on his own at the moment. These lands would be better returned to full Mwami control."
 BRW_divide_the_possessions_of_Rvagataraki: "Divide Rwagataraka's Holdings"
 BRW_divide_the_possessions_of_Rvagataraki_desc: "Rwagataraka is dead, so his lands are worth dividing among the king's heirs and creating new kingdoms on the ex-"empire" of Leon."
 BRW_appointment_of_ndugans: "Appoint Ndugans"
 BRW_appointment_of_ndugans_desc: "The appointment of the Ndugans, relatives of the king, from the Abanyiginya clan will strengthen the position of King Mutara and also restore the authority of the royal dynasty."
 BRW_centralize_power: "Centralize Power"
 BRW_centralize_power_desc: "The late Rwagataraka's lands should be annexed to those of Mwami personally and power centralized from one center and ordered by the King of Rwanda, not a local kingpin."
 BRW_take_control_of_bukunzi_and_busuzo: "Take Control of Bukunzi and Busuzo"
 BRW_take_control_of_bukunzi_and_busuzo_desc: "The kingdoms of Bukunzi and Busuzo were granted autonomous status by their chiefs who were popular with the people or had distinguished themselves to the administration. In 1925, the court granted Bukunzi special status because its leader, known for his rain-making abilities, was supposedly able to control rainfall throughout Rwanda. Busuzo was put under the control of Rwagataraki, but now that he is dead, it is worth putting it under Mwami rule."
 BRW_restoration_of_the_power_of_Abanyiginya: "Restore Abanyiginya's Power"
 BRW_restoration_of_the_power_of_Abanyiginya_desc: "The governing Abanyiginya dynasty gained a lot of prestige through their ruling, it is worth restoring the authority of the royal family."
 BRW_church_encouragement: "Promotion of the Church"
 BRW_church_encouragement_desc: "The Mwami of Rwanda has converted to Catholicism and his policies are very much to the liking of the administration, but at the same time he is causing discontent among the local people. The Catholic Church under him is gaining influence and it is our duty to support the monarch."
 BRW_preservation_of_precolonial_system: "Preserve Pre-Colonial Systems"
 BRW_preservation_of_precolonial_system_desc: "The plight of the peasants has been fixed for a long time, feudalism has existed in Rwanda for a very long time. But this does not mean that such things need to be reformed; if it pleases the chiefs, it is worth keeping things as they are, especially since the power of the Mwami is compressed by the colonial apparatus."
 BRW_liquidation_of_legal_obligations: "Liquidate Local Obligations"
 BRW_liquidation_of_legal_obligations_desc: "The plight of the peasants has been fixed for a long time and feudalism has existed in Rwanda for a very long time. This backward system needs to be reformed and many old obligations, in particular the barchina, should be canceled. However, this will not please the chiefs who live idle at the cost of heavy taxes."
 BRW_establish_belgian_style_production_of_guns: "Create a Belgian-style Rifle Production Facility"
 BRW_establish_belgian_style_production_of_guns_desc: "The purchase of foreign rifles is very expensive for our economy, so it is necessary to form our own production of weapons."

 BRW_social_tension: "Social Tension"
 BRW_social_tension_desc: "Belgium has ruthlessly exploited Rwanda-Urundi, using the proven governance practices of the Belgian Congo of plundering the country's natural wealth, including by creating and often supporting a traditional power structure. The ruling class of both the Rundi and Rwandan societies is composed of Tutsis (traditionally pastoralists), who have long ruled over the many times dominant Hutu farming group, as well as the Twa Pygmies (hunters and gatherers), who are at the bottom of the "social ladder". By exploiting this social stratification and the frequent property tensions between groups, Belgian administrators were able to direct Hutu anger and discontent not against the colonial administration, but against the dominant Tutsi group. All this creates violence between Hutu and Tutsi, which stratifies our society."
 BRW_ineffective_backward_labor: "Inefficient Backward Labor"
 BRW_ineffective_backward_labor_desc: "Belgium uses forced labor mercilessly in its territories, and millions of actual slaves obey their leaders, who in turn obey the colonial administration. Serious punishment awaits the offender for insubordination. The harsh rural environment, especially the many demands made on the population by the chiefs, played an important role in forcing Rwandans to migrate in search of work. In most parts of Rwanda-Urundi, earning opportunities were relatively limited and working conditions and pay were poor compared to neighboring regions in East Africa and Congo. From central, southern, and northern Rwanda, many migrated to Uganda or Tanganyika to escape rural extortions and to earn higher earnings than could be obtained at home."
 BRW_export_to_the_metropolis: "Exports to the Metropole"
 BRW_export_to_the_metropolis_desc: "All the produce goes to Belgium, leaving Rwanda-Urundi with only the bare minimum needed to keep the colony self-sustaining. The exploitation of our local resources limits our possibilities."
 BRW_catholic_education: "Catholic Education"
 BRW_catholic_education_desc: "Since the last government school was closed in 1929, the White Fathers' Catholic mission has taken control of the education system. A "two-tier" system was created in which Tutsis were trained for government employment and taught science, while at the same time Hutus were trained for work and prepared for labor. The Catholic faith, promoted by the colonial administration, was also promoted in schools, which the locals do not like."
 BRW_risk_of_famine: "Risk of Starvation"
 BRW_risk_of_famine_desc: "The Belgians were much more involved in the territory than the Germans, especially in Rwanda. Despite the rules of the mandate, which required the Belgians to develop the territories and prepare them for independence, the economic policies practiced in the Belgian Congo were exported to the east: the Belgians required that the territories make a profit for the metropoly, and that any development come from the funds that were collected in the territory. These funds mainly came from extensive coffee cultivation on the rich volcanic soils of the region. Thus the country is constantly at risk of starving, the slightest drought will destroy all the plantations."
 BRW_recruitment_ban: "Ban on Military Recruitment"
 BRW_recruitment_ban_desc: "According to the rules of the mandate, our country cannot create armed forces, but there is a "Force Publique" garrisoned within our territory to suppress all anti-colonial movements, thus keeping us safe."
 BRW_local_chiefs: "Local Leaders"
 BRW_local_chiefs_desc: "The Mwami of Rwanda and Urundi are no more than pawns in the hands of the colonial apparatus, but with the system of Tutsi superiority over Hutu that we have built, it is worth respecting their authority and perhaps heeding them. By doing so, we will strengthen the stability of the mandated lands. If the Mwami becomes too autocratic, we will have the right to replace him with another heir, but then the local population may not like it."
 BRW_administrative_union_with_congo: "Administrative Union with Congo"

 NW_BRW.0.t: "Mwami Mwambutsa IV Calls for Independence"
 NW_BRW.0.d: "Mwambutsa IV - King of Urundi, dissatisfied with the policy of colonialism, expressed his opinion on the self-determination of the Burundian kingdom. He was opposed by the chief  Baranyanka who was pleased with the Belgian administration. Belgium's mandate policy gives justification to both sides, but following the traditions of the Ganwa people, the still incumbent Mwami of Urundi became dissatisfied with the oppression of the Hutu. Arming several Mwami chiefs loyal to him personally, he declared that he is prepared to assert his position by force."
 NW_BRW.0.a: "It is necessary to replace him in his position"
 NW_BRW.0.b: "We'll crush him with force"
 NW_BRW.0.c: "We're going after Mwambutsa!"
 NW_BRW.1.t: "Mwambutsa's Retirement"
 NW_BRW.1.d: "With Mwambutsa's compelled resignation and his expulsion from the country, the question of who to place as King of Urundi has arisen. Our administration has identified two heirs: Prince Ludovico Rwasagore, who is a young monarch, unable to rule on his own in the coming years, so a regency council will be created, and an influential Ganwa leader, Pierre Baranyanka, loyal to Belgium."
 NW_BRW.1.a: "His replacement will be the direct heir"
 NW_BRW.1.b: "A more loyal chief will become more important than blood preservation"
 NW_BRW.2.t: "Baranyanka is Dissatisfied with Mwambutsa"
 NW_BRW.2.d: "The paramount chief of Ngozi province, Pierre Baranyanka, who had ties with and was satisfied with the Belgian administration, expressed his dissatisfaction with the Mwambutsa regime, which envisioned complete independence from Belgium and reform of the state. Having gained supporters from the Tutsi aristocracy, who benefited from the mandate, he opposed Mwambutsa's monarchy."
 NW_BRW.2.a: "Arrest him"
 NW_BRW.2.b: "Perhaps we should make some concessions to him....."
 NW_BRW.3.t: "The Chief Baranyanka is Asking for Protection."
 NW_BRW.3.d: "The fall of the colonial system in Rwanda-Urundi did not turn out well for Urundi. Chief Baranyanka, who was satisfied with his position in the mandate, asked Belgium for help to return to the land, promising to submit in exchange for Tutsi privileges."
 NW_BRW.3.a: "Tempting offer"
 NW_BRW.4.t: "The Uprising in Southern Urundi"
 NW_BRW.4.d: "After Mwambutsa's removal as mwami, news comes of a uprising taking place in the most symbolic place in Urundi: Nkoma, a place known as the ancestral home of the Burundian monarchy. Because King Ntare Rushatsi, the founder of the dynasty, was supposed to have come from Buha from the south through Nkoma. This rebel claims to be the son of Mwambutsa, born in 1925 in Mutaho from an unknown mother. He then moved to Moso, not without attracting many supporters. He is welcomed by the local population, who shout the arrival of the new king and put out the fire for the latter to reignite it."
 NW_BRW.4.a: "The Force Publique must be called upon to help!"
 NW_BRW.4.b: "Urundi will be free!"
 NW_BRW.5.t: "Mutara III Declared Independence"
 NW_BRW.5.d: "Surprisingly, the initially loyal Mwami Mutara III, appointed to replace Yuhi V, also adopted an anti-Belgian policy. He labeled us as homeland destroyers, and even some Hutu chiefs such as Nyamakwa III and the Catholic Tutsi chief Leon Rwagatarka sided with him. Such power forces us to leave the lands of Mutara, but he can be replaced and executed, but there is a problem - the young monarch has left no heirs."
 NW_BRW.5.a: "Well, it's time to change it, too."
 NW_BRW.5.b: "We'll crush him with force"
 NW_BRW.5.c: "We'll go with Mutara!"
 NW_BRW.6.t: "Replacement for Mutara III"
 NW_BRW.6.d: "With the forced resignation of Mutara and his expulsion from the country, the question of who should be the king of Rwanda has arisen. The administration has 2 heirs: Prince Dahindura, the son of Juhi V, who is a minor monarch, unable to rule on his own in the coming years, so a regency council will be established, and an influential leader, Leon Rwagatarka, who comes from Tutsi and is a Catholic, feuding with Juhi V. After Mutara's resignation, the people thought that he would be the one to rule."
 NW_BRW.6.a: "Rwagataraka is famous among the people, it is worth appointing him"
 NW_BRW.6.b: "Kigeli V is the legitimate successor"
 NW_BRW.7.t: "A Cattle Epidemicа"
 NW_BRW.7.d: "From Rwanda's Bugarura region, news has come of a cattle plague that is spreading, locally dubbed "muriamo", and it is spreading to nearby regions.\n\nBut the disasters do not end here. From the Ruhengeri region comes news of trypanosomiasis, a sleeping sickness of humans and cattle dubbed "Amashuya". As it turns out, cattle are infected with the deadly disease foot and mouth disease, which more than half of the diseased animals do not survive."
 NW_BRW.7.a: "It's worth investing in plague control"
 NW_BRW.7.b: "It won't go far"
 NW_BRW.8.t: "The Birth of Kigel V"
 NW_BRW.8.d: "The heir to the throne of the mwami of Rwanda, named Dahindura or Kigeli V, was born today. His father Juhi V, was sent into exile by the Belgian administration in 1931, because of his selfishness and lust, which indicated his anti-Christian behavior, then his son, secretly from his father, was baptized and placed to rule Rwanda."
 NW_BRW.8.a: "Let's rejoice for the Abaginha clan!"
 NW_BRW.9.t: "Relocation of Juha V's Residence"
 NW_BRW.9.d: "Juhi V, the former mwami of Rwanda was sent into exile by the past administration to Kamembe in the Moba region and replaced by his son Rudahigwa who was named Mutare III. The reason for the exile was that Mwami refused to accept Catholicism and officially for "selfishness and lust" and was probably against the mandate. To ensure his safety for the rest of his days, he was exiled abroad to Congo-Kinshas today."
 NW_BRW.9.a: "Got it"
 NW_BRW.10.t: "Death of Rwagataraki"
 NW_BRW.10.d: "The sad news for Rwanda came today - the great chief of Impara, the famous opponent of Juhi V Leon Rwagataraka has died. His holdings, dubbed the empire, were limited in 1934, but in fact he remained the strongest chief among all chiefdoms in Rwanda. Rudahigwa's favorite, Joseph Bideri, became the heir apparent."
 NW_BRW.10.a: "Sad news"
 NW_BRW.11.t: "Alumni of Astrid's school"
 NW_BRW.11.d: "The young princes trained at Astrida's school came to the political arena. Four Bezi, four Batare and Mutaga. Thus, these young administrators are the ones who will replace the old princes. Nowadays, instead of heredity, the criterion for participation in power is now the school, which day by day becomes concentrated in the hands of the Ganwa."
 NW_BRW.11.a: "New blood in our ranks"
 NW_BRW.12.t: "Increased Crime Rate"
 NW_BRW.12.d: "The road construction program undertaken and the increased administrative pressure on the population led to an overall increase in the crime rate. This became tangible for us after only a couple of months."
 NW_BRW.12.a: "The natives don't accept the benefits of civilization!"
 NW_BRW.13.t: "Falling Prices of "Educational" Crops"
 NW_BRW.13.d: "The policy of compulsory, or "educational" crops was a failure. As the price of crops fell, the income of peasants also fell. In contrast to the policy of mining, as industrial production increased, the need for subsistence agricultural products decreased."
 NW_BRW.13.a: "We wanted to keep them from starving....."
 NW_BRW.14.t: "Increased Crime Rate"
 NW_BRW.14.d: "The tightening of the law on reforestation and increased administrative pressure on the population led to an overall increase in the crime rate. This became tangible for us after only a couple of months."
 NW_BRW.14.a: "The natives don't accept the benefits of civilization!"
 NW_BRW.15.t: "The Famine of Ruzagayur"
 NW_BRW.15.d: "The policy of expanding exports of cheap agricultural commodities to the metropolis has had severe consequences. These conditions and the onset of drought this year, have led to the beginning of famine in Rwanda and northern Urundi. The Catholic mission is already preparing to organize a goods point in Bujumbura to help the starving peasants, but when it will arrive is unknown. The mwami of Rwanda has already helped and distributed food to the hungry. Of course, at the moment this is not saving anyone. The country has fallen into a severe famine."
 NW_BRW.15.a: "Terrible"
 NW_BRW.16.t: "End of starvation"
 NW_BRW.16.d: "The famine that began more than a year ago has been eliminated, farms have recovered. Our country suffered severe damage, hundreds of thousands of people emigrated, many died. This year has been a severe test for us."
 NW_BRW.16.a: "It's nice that it's over"
 NW_BRW.17.t: "League of Nations expresses its concern"
 NW_BRW.17.d: "The prohibition against recruiting natives in the Mandate territory has been violated by us. In response, the principal members of the League of Nations who still believe in the peace and ability of the organization protested. The violation of the terms of the Mandatory is a serious breach of the rules. We were obliged to rescind it, otherwise they would impose sanctions."
 NW_BRW.17.a: "Decree should be rescinded"
 NW_BRW.17.b: "What's the difference?"
 NW_BRW.18.t: "The king's order №4"
 NW_BRW.18.d: "The Abami of Rwanda, by Royal Order №4 following Order №3 on the establishment of a single tribunal, provides for the establishment of chiefdom funds and the organization of the Mutara / Musinga fund. The Mutara Fund is replenished from disciplinary fines imposed on deputy chiefs and chiefs, as well as judicial revenues from the territorial courts. The territorial courts come under the jurisdiction of the Mutara fund."
 NW_BRW.18.a: "The King is still in power"
 NW_BRW.18.b: "Cancel the King's decree"
 NW_BRW.19.t: "Increased crime rate"
 NW_BRW.19.d: "The rigorous vaccination campaign and increased administrative pressure on the population led to an overall increase in crime rates. This became tangible for us, after only a couple of months."
 NW_BRW.19.a: "Natives don't accept benefits of civilization!"
 NW_BRW.20.t: "Campaign is successful: it went off without a hitch"
 NW_BRW.20.d: "The campaign to control yaws by vaccination was successful. The natives did not strongly resist the administration's policy, some even came voluntarily rather than under obligation."
 NW_BRW.20.a: "That's success!"
 NW_BRW.21.t: "Campaign unsuccessful"
 NW_BRW.21.d: "The population expressed their strong opposition to a full examination of every individual. They found it particularly outrageous for male nurses and doctors to listen to women. Many tried to avoid it, but faced a tough stance from the administration, under pressure from the provincial governor, who made the campaign a priority and threatened the European framework, the administration and local African authorities with sanctions if sanctions were applied, disrupting the operation. The condemnations were more systematic than in other areas."
 NW_BRW.21.a: "The natives do not accept the benefits of modern medicine"
 NW_BRW.22.t: "Rwanda-Urundi proposes sanitary agreement"
 NW_BRW.22.d: "The Belgian administration in Rwanda-Urundi is proposing an agreement on the exchange of medicines and vaccines. This will improve the standard of living in the territories under our control."
 NW_BRW.22.a: "It's a win-win proposition"
 NW_BRW.22.b: "You shouldn't do business with Belgians..."
 NW_BRW.23.t: "[FROM.GetName] refuses"
 NW_BRW.23.d: "Unfortunately, the mutually beneficial proposal was passed between ears. The agreement to exchange medicines and vaccines was rejected."
 NW_BRW.23.a: "Sad"
 NW_BRW.24.t: "[FROM.GetName] agrees"
 NW_BRW.24.d: "Fortunately, the mutually beneficial offer was not passed between his ears."
 NW_BRW.24.a: "Great"
 NW_BRW.25.t: "Mwambutsa's marriage"
 NW_BRW.25.d: "Two children were born of the marriage to Queen Theresa Kanyonge; but this union is now in a precarious position, for the dowry, the compensation which the groom's family gives to the bride's family, the mwami, who must practice the custom of "buying back" children, who, in the case of marriage, do not quite belong to the family from the ordinary point of view, necessarily return to the mother or have to be "bought back," cannot afford to do so. This situation is due to the small salary of the mwami."
 NW_BRW.25.a: "To save the monarch, it's worth the investment"
 NW_BRW.25.b: "What do we care?"
 NW_BRW.26.t: "Mwambutsa Divorce IV"
 NW_BRW.26.d: "Mwami Urundi Mwambutsa IV's wife Teresa Kanyoga, who is the daughter of the Abasinya clan leader, demanded a divorce because of non-compliance with the tradition of "buying back" children. Thus the Urundi king's marriage collapsed, lowering his authority."
 NW_BRW.26.a: "That's sad news."
 NW_BRW.27.t: "Resistance to Christianization by the chiefs"
 NW_BRW.27.d: "Tutsi and some Hutu chiefs did not approve of the Catholic mission in their territory and chased the White Fathers out of their kingdoms. As the priests noted, the chiefs were prepared to use violence."
 NW_BRW.27.a: "The natives don't understand all the benefits of Christianity!"
 NW_BRW.27.b: "It's worth replacing"
 NW_BRW.28.t: "Successful application"
 NW_BRW.28.d: "The White Fathers' Catholic educational mission successfully converted the tribes of a province to Christianity. Many listened attentively and voluntarily accepted baptism when they understood the truth of the faith."
 NW_BRW.28.a: "Even we're surprised it went so smoothly"
 NW_BRW.29.t: "Resistance to Christianization"
 NW_BRW.29.d: "The White Fathers' Catholic educational mission was subjected to violence by the Hutu tribes, who became adamantly opposed to the Christianization campaign and violently chased the priests off the lands where they worked. Some natives have embraced the faith, but they are few in number."
 NW_BRW.29.a: "The natives don't understand all the benefits of Christianity!"
 NW_BRW.30.t: "Desperate resistance to Christianization"
 NW_BRW.30.d: "The White Fathers' Catholic outreach mission was subjected to serious violence by the Hutu tribes, who became strongly opposed to the Christianization campaign and brutally drove the priests off the lands where they were working, beating them with spears and stoning them, some of the priests dying in the line of duty to the Lord. Some of the natives accepted the faith, but they were few in number."
 NW_BRW.30.a: "The natives don't understand all the benefits of Christianity!"
 NW_BRW.31.t: "The King's Speech"
 NW_BRW.31.d: "From the beginning of his rule, the Mwami of Rwanda adhered to Belgian orders. His edicts clearly indicated loyalty to Belgium and the Catholic Church, he ordered chiefs to follow the colonialists' edicts. One of the mwami's decrees was what was popularly dubbed "the king's word," which meant that all Rwandans must profess Catholicism."
 NW_BRW.31.a: "He's a great ruler"
 NW_BRW.32.t: "Catholic King"
 NW_BRW.32.d: "When Rudahigwa was enthroned in 1931, some Rwandans were not happy about it: some said he was "the king from the source" (umwami wo mu isoko) when he was enthroned by "white men"; "the King who sits on an anthill" (the podium he stood on when he took the floor); "the one who beats people to madness" (the one who beats people to madness). His authority was initially low, so it is worth taking every step to strengthen his power."
 NW_BRW.32.a: "That's sad."
 NW_BRW.33.t: "Falling mandate"
 NW_BRW.33.d: "From our colonies in Africa came the news of the fall of the mandate of Rwanda-Urundi, given to our country after the surrender of Germany in the Great War. News reached us of the defeat of the colonial garrison and the declaration of independence of our colonies."
 NW_BRW.33.a: "Let's get back what is rightfully ours!"
 NW_BRW.33.b: "We couldn't keep them forever..."
 NW_BRW.34.t: "Rwandan uprising"
 NW_BRW.34.d: "The Hutu and Tutsi chiefs, as well as tribes dissatisfied with the Catholic mission, united against the mandate and the Belgian administration. To gain more support, they declared their leader Juhi V, who had been removed from power in favor of his son. Eager to regain power, he agreed and gathered his supporters into a centralized army, with which he dispersed the Force Publique in the Mandate territory. In doing so, he launched a full-fledged revolution in Rwanda, declaring himself monarch, Mutara III was forced to flee."
 NW_BRW.34.a: "God punish them!"
 NW_BRW.34.b: "Let's punish the foreigners!"
 NW_BRW.35.t: "Attempted revolution"
 NW_BRW.35.d: "The Hutu and Tutsi chiefs, as well as tribes dissatisfied with the Catholic mission, united against the mandate and the Belgian administration. In order to gain more support, they declared Juhi V, who had been exiled from the country, as their leader, and tried to bring him back, but he could not be returned. Finding themselves a decentralized rebellion without a strong leader, the leaders started their own war for power, and no one gained it. The attempted revolution was unsuccessful, but it left its mark."
 NW_BRW.35.a: "These natives tried to do something on their own and failed"
