They noted with concern «a general lack of interest in science and technology, especially among Japan's ruling class». In the liberal system, scientific research was either purely academic and detached from life, or was subordinated to the short-term commercial interests of the zaibatsu, who preferred to buy cheap foreign patents instead of developing their own research. To achieve scientific leadership, reformist bureaucrats initiated a «New Order for Science and Technology»."

He meant "comprehensive social planning."
 JAP_governing_State: "Managing State"
 JAP_governing_State_desc: "At the heart of the "New Order" lies the transformation of the very nature of the state. Reformist bureaucrats seek to replace the passive liberal "night watchman state" with a new, dynamic model - the "managing" (kanri kokka). The traditional bureaucracy, trained in law, saw its task as "applying the rules" and maintaining law and order. The "governing state," by contrast, had to be "activist, interventionist, and technically sophisticated." Its mandate is changing from the administration of laws to the effective and efficient management of the national defense State. This new type of state requires active cooperation between the bureaucracy, business and the military, blurring the traditional boundaries between the public and private sectors."

 JAP_Kashi_five_year_plan_desc: "Economic planning is the alpha and omega of the technocratic project. It was what distinguished the «managing state» from its liberal predecessor. Japanese technocrats were pragmatists and borrowed planning models from all available sources: in Nazi Germany, they observed the experience of industrial rationalization and four-year plans. In the Soviet Union, they studied five-year plans for industrialization. And even in the USA, they saw the «New Deal» programs and especially the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) project as a model of integrated regional development. Manchukuo became the ideal «laboratory» for these ideas. This was Japan's first attempt to create a planned economy from scratch. The bureaucrats in Manchukuo defined their system as a «partially planned economy», in contrast to the «totally planned economy» of the USSR. It allowed the private sector to exist, but key industries were controlled by the state."

Technocrats view Asia not as a collection of peoples, but as a single economic organism that needs to be rationally designed and managed as a single, integrated, self-sufficient "factory" under the leadership of Japanese engineers and managers. This is a technocratic view on an imperial scale."

The sphere of Co-prosperity was conceived by technocrats not as a set of colonies, but as a single "hierarchical, organic, functionalist community." This model was directly borrowed from the "diversified business structure" of the new zaibatsu. In this imperial structure, each region was assigned a clear function: Japan should become the core, the brain of the empire. Its function will be to provide "technological leadership," capital, and senior management personnel. Manchukuo and Northern China will become the industrial base of the empire, the center of heavy and chemical industries (steel, coal, synthetic fuels). Southeast Asia will be a peripheral supplier of critically important raw materials (oil, rubber, tin)."

This order divided the world into two categories: the "haves" countries with colonies and natural resources (like the USA and Great Britain), and the "have-nots" countries to which they referred Japan, Germany and Italy. This liberal order, based on control over raw materials and the principles of free trade, placed countries like Japan in eternal dependence. The worldview shared by technocrats requires a "geopolitical reorganization" of the world."

 JAP_replace_class_consciousness_with_ethnic_consciousness_desc: "The key ideological problem that the New Order was supposed to solve was class conflict. Technocrats view liberalism and Marxism as "materialistic" ideologies that split the nation into warring classes (capitalists against workers), which was absolutely unacceptable in a total war. The solution was found in their own ideology, developed by figures such as Mōri Hideoto and Okumura Kivao. They seek to combine technocratic planning with Japanese nationalism. "Ethnic consciousness" was presented as a higher, "spiritual" and "organic" force that transcends material class differences. Mōri Hideoto, relying on German theorists such as Gottl, argued that there are no more classes within the framework of the "national economy" (Volkswirtschaft). Instead, there are only functions. Capitalists, managers, and workers are all "organizers" who perform different tasks in a single "ethnic cooperative body" (minzoku kyodotai)."
 JAP_growth_of_power_and_prestige_of_managers: "Growth of Power and Prestige of Managers"
 JAP_growth_of_power_and_prestige_of_managers_desc: "Total war and empire management require complex, long-term economic and industrial planning. Tasks such as developing five-year plans, mobilizing resources, rationalizing industry, and managing large businesses are too difficult for the old elites accustomed to laissez-faire or political intrigue. This demand for expertise "has brought to life new government planning agencies, research bureaus, and think tanks." Reformist bureaucrats, engineers, and economists quickly took these new "central nodes" of power, which became their institutional base. This rise in power was not only factual, but also ideological. Kishi Nobusuke and his colleagues sincerely believe that their legitimacy is based not on wealth or origin, but on "technical expertise." They promote the idea that in a difficult modern era, "only leaders with managerial abilities and expertise should manage." Thus, Manchukuo, and then the wartime Japanese Empire, became the first state where the managerial class openly claimed supreme power."
 JAP_managerial_revolution: "Managerial Revolution"
 JAP_managerial_revolution_desc: "The movement of reformist bureaucrats was not just a seizure of power; it was a "managerial revolution." This managerial revolution was a direct ideological challenge to Marxism. Marx argued that technology is a "means of labor." However, in the new era of mass production, as the technocrats noted, the opposite happened: "labor becomes a means of technology." The production unit was not an individual worker, but the entire "organization" (factory, corporation, bureaucracy). In this new reality, the decisive power did not belong to the one who owned the car (the capitalist) or he worked on it (a worker), and the one who organized the entire system into a single whole was a manager or a technocrat. Thus, the "managerial revolution" argued that organization and technology, not class, were the true engines of history, and therefore technocrats were destined to become the future ruling class."
 JAP_centralization_of_governing_bodies: "Centralization of Governing Bodies"
 JAP_centralization_of_governing_bodies_desc: "One of the main problems on the way to a "governing state" was the traditional "bureaucratic sectionalism." The Japanese government is divided into competing ministries (the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of the Interior, the Army, the Navy), each of which pursues its own narrow interests, which makes it impossible to plan a unified total war. The solution proposed by military and civilian technocrats was to create a "technical substructure" within the bureaucracy. This substructure consisted of a network of powerful "supra-ministerial" planning bodies that were designed specifically to "overcome the problem of bureaucratic sectionalism." These new bodies were staffed by technocrats from different ministries and reported directly to the Cabinet of Ministers, which allowed them to coordinate policy over the heads of traditional ministries."
 JAP_divide_capital_and_management: "Share Capital and Management"
 JAP_divide_capital_and_management_desc: "The principle of "separating capital from management" is the central element of the "Economic New Order" and the main tool of the reformist bureaucrats in their struggle against zaibatsu. The ideological basis of this concept was the famous American study of Adolf Burley and Gardiner Means "Modern Corporation and Private Property" in 1933. Technocrats like Okumura Kivao have studied this work closely. Burley and Means argued that in modern large corporations, where shares are widely dispersed, de facto separation has already occurred: the owners (shareholders) have lost control, and real power has passed to the managers who ran the company."
 JAP_honor_to_engineers_and_scientists: "Honor to Engineers and Scientists"
 JAP_honor_to_engineers_and_scientists_desc: "One of the main goals of the "New Order" is to change the social status of technical specialists. Japan's traditional bureaucratic hierarchy was dominated by people who had law degrees from Tokyo Imperial University. Engineers and technicians held subordinate positions, had a lower rank, and were "largely excluded from policy development." Reformist bureaucrats consider this system outdated and destructive for a state waging total war."
 JAP_rethink_professional_roles_and_identities: "Rethink Professional Roles and Identities"
 JAP_rethink_professional_roles_and_identities_desc: "The "New Order" is not only an economic, but also a deeply social and ideological revolution. His goal is to "fight ideas" and fundamentally change the "liberal-capitalist mentality." This requires a complete rethinking of the professional roles and identity of each member of society. This rethinking of roles is necessary to create an "organic" society in which conflict between groups would be replaced by functional harmony aimed at achieving a common goal — building an empire."
 JAP_eliminate_the_privileges_of_the_upper_classes: "Eliminate the Privileges of the Upper Classes"
 JAP_eliminate_the_privileges_of_the_upper_classes_desc: "The new technocratic order is incompatible with Japan's old elite. Reformist bureaucrats have no patience for the privileged, old-fashioned elite. This criticism is directed primarily against traditional zaibatsu such as Mitsui and Mitsubishi, as well as against the old aristocracy and conservative politicians. The problem with this elite is that its power and privileges were based on a "family" tradition and passive ownership of capital, rather than on real «managerial abilities and expertise»."
 JAP_improve_the_situation_of_the_working_class: "Improve the Situation of the Working Class"
 JAP_improve_the_situation_of_the_working_class_desc: "The plans of the reformist bureaucrats to "improve the situation of the working class" were not dictated by humanitarian or egalitarian considerations. It was a functional necessity aimed at increasing productivity and preventing class conflicts that threatened total mobilization. This strategy was embodied in the "New Order for Labor." The aim of the program was to "raise the status of workers" and instill a national "spirit of work", replacing antagonistic relations with cooperation."
 JAP_defeat_the_liberal_capitalist_mentality: "Defeat Japan's Liberal Capitalist Mentality"
 JAP_defeat_the_liberal_capitalist_mentality_desc: "Criticism of liberal capitalism was a fundamental stone in the ideology of the reformist bureaucrats. They didn't just reject certain aspects of the system; they attacked its fundamental principles: private ownership, private profit, and business autonomy. For these new management elites, the Great Depression and the accompanying financial crisis in Japan became irrefutable proof of the collapse and "explosion" of the liberal capitalist system. Technocrats believe that capitalism "subordinates" technological progress to "non-technical goals" (the pursuit of profit), thereby "sabotaging" national power. Therefore, in order to fully unleash the potential of science and technology and build a "technocratic superpower," it was necessary to first defeat the liberal mentality. It should be replaced by new technocratic principles: "organization man," "public profit" and comprehensive «planning»."
 JAP_overcome_modernity: "Overcome Modernity"
 JAP_overcome_modernity_desc: "The concept of "Overcoming modernity" was a central theme for Japanese intellectuals of the modern period, and reformist bureaucrats offered their own, technocratic version of its solution. They promoted the creation of an alternative modernity. This new modernity was supposed to be technologically cutting-edge, but at the same time "organic," hierarchical, and ideologically unified."
 JAP_new_order_in_all: "New Order in Everything and Everywhere"
 JAP_new_order_in_all_desc: "The "New Order" is the greatest creation of reformist bureaucrats. The movement is unprecedented in its comprehensiveness and breadth of vision. It represents the most direct attack on the strongholds of liberal capitalism. It also represents the most ambitious bid for power by Japanese technocrats. Under the leadership of Kishi Nobusuke, reformist bureaucrats have developed a bold and comprehensive program to restructure Japan's economy and society. Over the past two years, they have developed plans for various "new orders" in industry, finance, labor, science, technology, communications, and national land management that affect all areas of life."

 JAP_advancing_the_royal_path: "Advance the Royal Path"
 JAP_advancing_the_royal_path_desc: "Advancing the Royal Path was the central element of the moral and ideological justification for the 'East Asian Reform'. Ishiwara borrowed this ancient Chinese concept, contrasting it with Western imperialism. The Royal Path (Ōdō) is an Asian ideal of governance based on benevolence, morality, and harmony. It is opposed to Hadō (The Way of Force) — the Western method based on brute force, exploitation, and the 'immoral \"role of power\"'. Ishiwara argues that his 'East Asian League' is founded on the Royal Path, offering Asian nations 'harmony' instead of subjugation."
 JAP_nation_state_in_the_past: "Nation-state in the past"
 JAP_nation_state_in_the_past_desc: "Perhaps Ishiwara's most heretical idea in the domestic political context was his belief that the 'nation-state is a temporary stage of history'. He is a historical determinist who believes that humanity is inevitably moving 'towards larger political entities'. Nation-states, in his view, will have to give way to 'regional blocs' (such as his 'East Asian League'), and these blocs, in turn, will have to merge into a single world government after the 'Final War'. This belief in a 'supranational entity' places him in direct conflict with the Genri Nippon ultranationalists, who believe in the eternal and absolute uniqueness of the Japanese Kokutai (national essence)."
 JAP_self_government_for_korea: " Self-Governance for Korea"
 JAP_self_government_for_korea_desc: "Ishiwara's position on Korea is a direct logical consequence of his theory on the transient nature of nation-states. The East Asian League is one of the few Japanese organizations of our time that is 'critical of Japanese colonial policy' and opposes forced assimilation. The movement recognized 'Korea's national aspirations' and called for a 'form of Korean self-governance'. This stance attracted a significant number of Koreans to the League, including figures like Cho Yong-ju, who saw the movement as the only viable path to 'Korean independence'. However, the League remains in an 'ambiguous position', advocating for 'self-governance' within the League rather than full independence."

 JAP_restoration_of_the_sowing_is_a_great_transformation_desc: "The Showa Restoration is the primary slogan of the East Asian League. However, Ishiwara invests this term with a much more radical meaning than other right-wing factions. For him, it was not merely a political reshuffling, but a 'Great Transformation' (Shōwa isshinron). This transformation will be total. It must occur not only 'at the level of politics and economics', but also 'at the level of the individual, their clothing, housing, food, and mental attitude'. It will be an all-encompassing revolution covering geopolitics, economics, social structure, technology, and personal spirituality, aiming to create an entirely new type of civilization capable of waging and winning the 'Final War'."

 JAP_restoration_of_the_unity_of_rituals_and_rules_desc: "Saisei Itchi, or 'restoring the unity of rites and rules', was the central philosophical mechanism of the 'Great Transformation'. Traditionally, this term meant the 'unity of religion and politics', and the East Asian League indeed called for this. However, Ishiwara expanded this concept to the 'unity of religion and science'. He believes that the 'disease' of modernity lies in differentiation — the separation of faith and reason, religion and science, politics and morality. His utopia is based on 'unification'. He argues that Nichiren Buddhism and advanced science (such as the theory of evolution) ultimately point to the same cosmic truth. Restoring the unity of rites and rules is his formula for 'overcoming modernity' by reintegrating them."
 JAP_global_tenno: "Global Tenno"
 JAP_global_tenno_desc: "Ishiwara's eschatology reached its peak in the concept of the 'Global Tenno'. After the 'Final War' destroys the old order based on nation-states, the world is to be united. Ishiwara predicted that this unification would occur with the 'Tenno (Emperor) as the spiritual Buddhist leader'. This was an extremely radical and heretical idea. The East Asian League argues that this 'Global Tenno' would be 'separated from the nation of Japan' and that non-Japanese would also have the right to be his followers. This enraged Japanese ultranationalists, who condemned the East Asian League for 'betraying the Kokutai', as they insisted that the Tenno cannot be separated from the Japanese nation."
 JAP_reorganization_of_the_urban_environment: "Urban Reorganisation"
 JAP_reorganization_of_the_urban_environment_desc: "The reorganization of the urban environment is a fundamental component of Ishiwara's domestic revolution. He concluded that the modern metropolis, whether in Japanese or Western style, is strategically vulnerable, economically exploitative, and morally corrupt. The East Asian League's program includes 'religious engagement with issues of modernization, such as urbanization and the countryside'. Ishiwara and his followers viewed the existing urban environment as a source of the 'diseases of modernity'. Their plan required not merely reform, but a complete rethinking and physical deconstruction of urban space, bringing us to his more radical concepts."
 JAP_decentralization_of_management: "Decentralisation of Management"
 JAP_decentralization_of_management_desc: "Ishiwara's program requires a radical decentralization of management, which would be a direct consequence of his plan for spatial reorganization. By dismantling centralized cities — which are not only population centers but also hubs of political and economic power — Ishiwara aims to disperse governance. The new model of management is to be based on a network of self-sufficient, high-tech rural communes. This decentralized structure was vital for both military and ideological reasons. Militarily, it made the nation less vulnerable to a 'decapitating strike' on the capital. Ideologically, it aligned with his vision of overcoming the hierarchical and exploitative structures of 'modernity'."
 JAP_the_era_of_cities_is_over: "Era of Cities is Over"
 JAP_the_era_of_cities_is_over_desc: "This thesis is foundational to Ishiwara's spatial theory. He asserts that 'the era of cities has come to an end'. This conclusion was based on a threefold analysis. First, as a military strategist, he sees a fatal vulnerability in cities. The Great Kanto Earthquake of 1923 demonstrated their fragility in the face of natural disasters. More importantly, the development of aviation meant that cities would become primary targets for 'large-scale aerial bombardment' in the future 'Final War'. Second, he believes cities are centers of moral decay, filled with 'hedonism' and 'American culture' — manifestations of 'Western materialism' he seeks to eradicate. Third, he views cities as economically parasitic structures that developed by exploiting the countryside. Thus, declaring the 'end of the era of cities' is both a strategic forecast and an ideological imperative."
 JAP_restoration_of_farming_villages: "Restoration of Farming Villages"
 JAP_restoration_of_farming_villages_desc: "The restoration of farming villages is the constructive side of 'dismantling cities'. The village was not merely to accept the displaced urban population; it was to be completely transformed to become the new center of Japanese civilization. This program is deeply rooted in the East Asian League's Buddhist worldview. The new villages are to become 'utopian communities', functioning as 'intentional communities' that will serve as a 'model for the reform of the country and, ultimately, the world'. These villages are to develop 'centered on \"reverence for the gods\"', representing a moral and spiritual revival contrasting with the perceived decay of the cities. Importantly, this vision was not a nostalgia for Japan's medieval rural way of life, characteristic of the Nōhonshugi movement. The East Asian League explicitly distinguishes its future vision from Nōhonshugi. Ishiwara's village will not be primitive, but futuristic — a high-tech, industrialized, and spiritually pure center."
 JAP_abolition_of_the_division_between_the_city_and_the_countryside: "Abolition of the Urban-Rural Division"
 JAP_abolition_of_the_division_between_the_city_and_the_countryside_desc: "The ultimate goal of Ishiwara's spatial reorganization is the 'abolition of the division between the city and the countryside'. He sees this division — where one region produces (the village) and the other consumes and rules (the city) — as the fundamental rift of modernity that breeds economic inequality and spiritual alienation. His solution is not a simple return to the agrarian past. Instead, he proposed a dialectical synthesis. Ishiwara views history as follows:\n\n1. Thesis: Primitive agrarian society (unity).\n\n2. Antithesis: Modern industrial society (division of city and countryside).\n\n3. Synthesis: The future utopian society that 'integrates city and countryside, industry and agriculture'. This synthesis was to be achieved by creating a new type of settlement that would be simultaneously rural and industrial."
 JAP_dismantling_of_cities: "Dismantle Cities"
 JAP_dismantling_of_cities_desc: "Toshi Kaitai (literally 'dismantling of cities') is a specific political slogan and mechanism for achieving the 'end of the era of cities'. This plan envisages the forced, planned dispersal of urban population and industry into the countryside. Millions of people are to be relocated from areas like Tokyo-Yokohama to rural prefectures. The motives for this are simultaneously strategic (protection from airstrikes), ideological (eradication of Western hedonism), and economic (ending the exploitation of the village). It would be a radical, totalitarian form of social engineering necessary for the nation's survival in the 'Final War'."
 JAP_sendai_model_region: "Sendai Model Region"
 JAP_sendai_model_region_desc: "To realize his vision, Ishiwara and the East Asian League developed a concrete prototype: the 'Shonai Model Region'. Shonai, a region in Ishiwara's home prefecture of Yamagata, was chosen as the testing ground for his entire 'Showa Restoration' program. A key document, the 'Shonai Land Planning Draft', outlines this plan. Shonai is to become a 'model' for reform and a 'pioneer of the Showa Restoration'. The plan for Shonai was a microcosm of his entire national program, combining 'dismantling of cities', 'unity of agriculture and industry', and other social reforms such as the 'Army for Public Service'."
 JAP_association_of_agriculture_and_industry: "Integrate Agriculture and Industry"
 JAP_association_of_agriculture_and_industry_desc: "Nōkō Ittai, or the 'unity of agriculture and industry', is the cornerstone of the Shonai economic model and the second of the East Asian League's 'three principles'. It is a concrete policy designed to 'abolish the division between the city and the countryside'. Instead of concentrating industry in vulnerable cities, Nōkō Ittai proposes distributing it across the countryside. This would lead to the creation of 'self-sufficient communities' where 'all citizens would become farmers' to some degree, ending the division of labor between agriculture and industry. This model was intended to create an economically self-sufficient, socially cohesive, and strategically invulnerable 'National Defense State'."
 JAP_construction_of_communal_factories_in_the_village: "Build Communal Factories in the Countryside"
 JAP_construction_of_communal_factories_in_the_village_desc: "The physical realization of Nōkō Ittai was the 'construction of communal factories in the village'. The Shonai plan explicitly called for placing 'communal factories in the center of villages'. These factories should not be primitive workshops. On the contrary, they must be high-tech and fully integrated into rural life. This would be a radical decentralization of the Japanese industrial base, designed to make production resilient to aerial bombardment and to transfer economic power from urban capitalists (whom Ishiwara despises) to rural communities."
 JAP_mechanization_of_agriculture: "Agricultural Mechanisation"
 JAP_mechanization_of_agriculture_desc: "Parallel to electrification, Ishiwara's plan demands the 'wider use of mechanized agriculture'. This will be necessary to achieve food self-sufficiency (autarky), especially under conditions of total war when labor will be in short supply. Mechanization is also key to his social theory. By freeing the population from hard manual labor, technology would allow 'all citizens to be farmers' without sacrificing industrial production or cultural development. This is part of Ishiwara's pursuit of the 'harmony of science and technology' with religion."
 JAP_rural_electrification: "Rural Electrification"
 JAP_rural_electrification_desc: "Ishiwara's agrarian utopia is completely dependent on modern technology. Central to this was 'rural electrification'. The Shonai plan specifically provides for the 'introduction of electricity into farmhouses'. This is not a minor detail; it is necessary for the 'communal factories' to function and for mechanized agriculture to work. Electricity is the technology that will allow decentralized villages to achieve industrial productivity equal to or exceeding that of the old cities, proving that Ishiwara's vision is not retrograde, but futuristic."
 JAP_social_reforms: "Social Reforms"
 JAP_social_reforms_desc: "The term 'social reforms' covers the non-economic aspects of Ishiwara's 'Great Transformation'. The East Asian League is deeply concerned with the 'broad crisis of modernity', which includes not only economics and war but also 'gender inequality' and the role of 'minorities'. His program aims to 'create a Buddhist utopia' that would resolve these social problems through the lens of Nichiren Buddhism."
 JAP_army_for_public_service: "Army for Public Service"
 JAP_army_for_public_service_desc: "To achieve total societal mobilization while simultaneously executing major infrastructure projects (such as land reclamation and factory construction), the Shonai plan proposes a form of conscription called the 'Army for Public Service'. This organization is to 'work for all kinds of public good'. It would not be merely a public works program; it is a tool for the militarization of all society. It blurs the line between soldier and civilian, farmer and worker, embodying the ideal of the 'National Defense State', where every citizen is constantly mobilized in service to the state in preparation for the 'Final War'."
 JAP_equality_for_women: "Equality for Women"
 JAP_equality_for_women_desc: "One of the most distinctive features of the East Asian League is its progressive stance on 'equality for women'. According to Ishiwara, the East Asian League was 'the only organization in Japan that has insisted on equal rights for women since pre-war times'. This position was not borrowed from Western liberalism, which Ishiwara rejects. It is based on his Nichiren Buddhist theology. Leaders of the East Asian League, such as Koizumi Kikue, grounded their feminism in the 12th chapter of the 'Lotus Sutra', which proclaimed that women can achieve Buddhahood. Ishiwara actively encouraged female leaders and sought to mobilize women as a key force in his movement, considering their 'spiritual independence' and 'maternal love' vital for the nation's moral regeneration."
 JAP_development_of_new_agricultural_lands: "Develop New Agricultural Lands"
 JAP_development_of_new_agricultural_lands_desc: "To ensure food security for the 'National Defense State', especially after the loss of colonies as food sources, the East Asian League's program provides for the 'development of new agricultural lands'. This measure, included in the Shonai plan, is a pragmatic response to the problem of autarky. It must be implemented in tandem with new agricultural technologies (mechanization and enzyme fertilizers) to maximize domestic production and ensure that Japan can wage a protracted 'Final War' without reliance on imports."
 JAP_change_your_diet: "Change the Diet"
 JAP_change_your_diet_desc: "Achieving autarky requires not only a change in production but also a change in consumption. The Shonai plan is revolutionary in its proposal to 'change the diet' of the nation. The most striking example of this is the proposal to consume 'more milk and butter instead of rice'. This is a radical departure from the millennial culture based on rice. This move is dictated by pure strategic pragmatism: diversifying calorie sources and promoting products that could be more efficiently produced domestically within the new agro-industrial model, making the nation less vulnerable to blockades."
 JAP_use_enzyme_fertilizers: "Use Enzyme Fertilisers"
 JAP_use_enzyme_fertilizers_desc: "To drastically increase yields on developed and existing lands, the East Asian League actively promotes the use of enzyme fertilizers. Amid wartime shortages of food and fertilizer, this promise to significantly boost yields attracted many farmers to the movement. The choice of enzymes was also ideological. It represented an organic, self-sufficient, Japanese method of increasing fertility, in contrast to dependence on imported, Western chemical fertilizers. This was part of a broader program to achieve complete self-sufficiency as a prerequisite for the 'Final War'."
 JAP_infrastructure_development: "Develop Infrastructure"
 JAP_infrastructure_development_desc: "A decentralized network of high-tech villages would be inefficient without appropriate infrastructure connecting them. Ishiwara's vision was not one of isolated communes. On the contrary, it provides for 'infrastructure development' to ensure connectivity. The East Asian League envisioned that these new decentralized communities would be 'connected by high-speed railways and air routes'. This underscores the techno-utopian nature of his program. Ishiwara wants the benefits of decentralization (invulnerability, spiritual purity) combined with the benefits of centralization (speed, connectivity, logistics), made possible by advanced transport technologies."
 JAP_emphasis_on_scientific_knowledge: "Focus on Scientific Knowledge"
 JAP_emphasis_on_scientific_knowledge_desc: "Contrary to any notion of him as a traditionalist mystic, Ishiwara placed absolute 'emphasis on scientific knowledge'. His own faith was underpinned by what he considered a 'scientific analysis of war' and 'technical research of military history'. The East Asian League argues that Nichiren Buddhism is the only faith capable of truly uniting religion and science. They criticized Christianity for a 'lack of scientific spirit' and Marxism for 'relying too one-sidedly on science'. For Ishiwara, science was not an adversary of faith, but its ultimate confirmation."
 JAP_search_for_new_energy_sources: "Search for New Energy Sources"
 JAP_search_for_new_energy_sources_desc: "The emphasis on aviation is inextricably linked to the search for new energy sources. Ishiwara predicted that the technology of the 'Final War' would involve 'aircraft with as yet unknown energy sources' that would allow for 'destructive strikes on the capitals of other nations'. Although he did not use the term 'nuclear', his prediction in the 1930s of a new, compact energy source that would turn aircraft into weapons of apocalyptic urban destruction was an eerie foresight of the atomic age. His entire 'National Defense State' strategy was designed for survival in such a war."
 JAP_focus_on_aviation: "Focus on Aviation"
 JAP_focus_on_aviation_desc: "In Ishiwara's 'scientific analysis of war', aviation held a central place. He was one of the earliest and most ardent proponents of air power theory. He predicted that the 'Final War' would be 'fought almost entirely in the air'. He believed that aviation had become the 'absolute weapon' that would render traditional armies and navies obsolete. It was this belief in the decisive role of aviation that directly led to his program of 'dismantling cities', as cities were defenseless against this new weapon."
 JAP_avoiding_economic_dogmatism: "Avoiding Economic Dogmatism"
 JAP_avoiding_economic_dogmatism_desc: "Ishiwara's economic program is radically pragmatic and avoids the dogmas of both the Left and the Right. His Nōkō Ittai model represents a 'third way'. He fiercely criticizes capitalism for being based on 'Western materialism', 'hedonism', and the exploitation of the countryside. At the same time, he rejected Marxism. Ishiwara and his followers, such as Cho Yong-ju, considered Marxism merely another form of Western materialism that 'relies too one-sidedly on science' and is completely devoid of the spirituality necessary for the 'unity of science and religion'. His decentralized, spiritually-oriented, high-tech communitarian model was designed to transcend both of these 'flawed' Western dogmas."
 JAP_moral_revival: "Moral Revival"
 JAP_moral_revival_desc: "A 'moral revival' is considered the spiritual prerequisite for Ishiwara's entire program. He believes that Japan cannot defeat the materially superior West if it is itself spiritually corrupted by 'Western materialism'. The 'Final War' will be not only a military battle but also a moral one. This revival is to be achieved through spiritual purification (a return to Nichiren Buddhism as the supreme truth), spatial purification (dismantling corrupt cities and returning to a 'simple life' in new farming villages based on 'reverence for the gods'), and physical purification (participation in labor through the 'Army for Public Service')."
 JAP_the_lotus_sutra_project: "The Lotus Sutra Project"
 JAP_the_lotus_sutra_project_desc: "In \"A Large View of War History\" Ishiwara not only emphasized the role of aviation in future wars, but also pointed to the use of nuclear fission energy in military affairs. The work on its creation was designated as the \"Lotus Sutra Project\"."
 JAP_formation_of_the_highest_culture: "Formation of the Highest Culture"
 JAP_formation_of_the_highest_culture_desc: "The ultimate, non-military goal of the 'Great Transformation' was the 'formation of the highest culture'. According to the East Asian League's definition, this 'highest culture' could only be created 'through the perfect harmonization of science and religion'. This culture would be 'highest' because it would be holistic. It would overcome the schisms of modernity (science vs. faith, city vs. country, man vs. nature) that Ishiwara considered the source of conflict and suffering. This culture, based on the 'unity of rites and rules', would become the foundation for 'eternal peace'."

 JAP_getting_rid_of_western_materialism: "Getting Rid of Western Materialism"
 JAP_getting_rid_of_western_materialism_desc: "The main ideological enemy standing in the way of the 'highest culture' was 'Western materialism'. The East Asian League used this term to denote both dominant ideologies of the West: liberal capitalism and Marxism. Capitalism was condemned as 'hedonistic consumerism' and 'American culture' that corrupted cities. Marxism was dismissed as a 'sect' that 'relies too one-sidedly on science' and denies spiritual reality. The entire 'Showa Restoration' program was designed to ideologically and physically 'inoculate' Japan against this Western 'disease'."
 JAP_focus_on_scientific_research: "Focus on Scientific Research"
 JAP_power_through_science: "Power through Science"
 JAP_power_through_science_desc: "The ultimate goal of the East Asian League — the 'formation of the highest culture' — is to be achieved 'through the perfect harmonization of science and religion'. 'Power through science' is not merely a military slogan but a philosophical imperative. Science provided the power not only to create new weapons but also to regenerate society. Ishiwara believed that science, such as the 'theory of evolution', confirms Buddhist intuition about the 'unity of all human races' and 'all living beings'. Thus, scientific progress was inseparable from spiritual progress."
 JAP_fulfill_nichiren_prediction: "Fulfill Nichiren's Prediction" 
 JAP_apocalypse: "Apocalypse"
 JAP_apocalypse_desc: "'The Apocalypse', or the 'Final War' (Saishū Sensō), is the 'trunk' from which all of Ishiwara's other ideas grow. It was the central, all-consuming idea. It had a dual basis. First, scientific determinism – his 'scientific analysis of war' and 'technical research of military history' led him to the conclusion that technology (especially aviation and new energy) makes total, global war inevitable. Second, as a religious prophecy, his 'Nichiren eschatology' and belief in Nichiren's prophecy of a 'titanic global struggle' in the era of mappō (the Latter Day of the Law) gave this scientific inevitability a divine meaning. The 'Final War' was thus a necessary and desirable apocalypse — an act of creative destruction that was to destroy the corrupt old world and pave the way for a new, unified, and spiritual order."
 JAP_world_peace: "World Peace"
 JAP_world_peace_desc: "The ultimate goal of the apocalypse was 'World Peace'. Ishiwara is, in essence, an 'apocalyptic pacifist'. He believes that the 'Final War' will be so total and destructive (due to aviation) that it will make war itself impossible. After this last, cleansing war, the world will finally reach its ultimate goal. It will become 'unified, peaceful, and Buddhist', united under the spiritual leadership of the 'Global Tenno' and living in a 'highest culture' based on the 'unity of science and religion'. Ishiwara's entire radical and often brutal program was, in his mind, the only path to achieving this 'eternal peace'."

In subsequent years, as a military commander of both young officers and recruits from impoverished rural areas, Chichibu became increasingly aware of the need to improve what he called the 'wretched condition of soldiers and their families'."

Given the respect the Emperor enjoyed in Japanese society, Kita considered the monarch the ideal candidate to suspend the Constitution, create an Emperor-appointed council, and radically reorganize the Cabinet and the Diet, whose members would be elected by the people to free them from any 'malign influence', clarifying the true meaning of the Restoration. By retaining the Emperor as the representative of the people, the privileged elites would be displaced."

In it, he criticized Marxism and class-struggle-oriented socialism as outdated. Instead, he emphasized evolutionary theory to understand the basic principles of the development of societies and nations. In this book, Kita openly advocates a Platonic state of authoritarianism, emphasizing the close connection between Confucianism and the concept of 'national socialism from above', arguing that Mencius is the Plato of the East and that Plato's concept of social organization is far preferable to Marx's."

In his view, the only reason English hasn't destroyed Japan yet is that German had more influence than English. Kita also called for English to be banished from the country. Kita was inspired by several Chinese anarchists he befriended in the early twentieth century. They urged the replacement of Esperanto with Chinese."
 JAP_introduction_of_Esperanto: "Implementation of Esperanto"
 JAP_introduction_of_Esperanto_desc: "In 1919, Kita proposed that the Japanese Empire adopt Esperanto as its official language. He foresaw that a hundred years after the adoption of Esperanto, the language would become the sole medium of communication both within Japan itself and in the vast territories that, according to the theory of natural selection, would be conquered by the empire. In Kita's view, Japanese could become the Sanskrit or Latin equivalent of the empire. Kita believes the Japanese writing system is too complex to be imposed on other peoples. He also argues that romanization would not work, and English, which was taught in the Japanese education system at the time, had not been mastered by the Japanese."

Then Japan could become a superpower analogous to the USA or Russia. A common theme of his early and later political works is the concept of Kokutai, through the achievement of which Japan would overcome the looming national crisis of economics or international relations, lead a united and free Asia, and unify world culture through Japanized and universalized Asian ideas to prepare for the emergence of the sole superpower that would be inevitable for future world peace."

He also believed that China and the Soviet Union would join the war on America's side. He proposed that Japan ally with France and fight the Soviet Union. He believed that an alliance with France would restrain the British Empire, and that Japan and France shared anti-Russian sentiments since the Russian Empire had not repaid a huge debt to France."

He argued that along with accepting Chinese, Koreans, and Russians as Japanese citizens during the Meiji period, any person should be able to naturalize as a citizen of the empire regardless of race, with the same rights and obligations as ethnic Japanese. According to Kita, the Japanese Empire could not otherwise expand into territories inhabited by non-Japanese without 'relieving them of their obligations or expelling them from the empire'."

Just as an enthusiastic musician is not satisfied with a hired instrument, so a toiling farmer cannot maintain his labor zeal on rented land. The revolutionary view of man only as a social animal is one-sided and equal to the thesis of the old economic school that the interests of personal gain are the impetus for economic life. Both of these extremes are wrong. Man possesses both public and private interests. The coming reconstruction in the organization of society cannot be conducted on the basis of these extremes, which do not see the essence of man.'"

In Japan, calls to abolish or reform the House of Peers also began to arise as early as the first half of the 1920s. At the moment, the most conservative representatives of the elite gather there, so its abolition is a guarantee for carrying out Ikki Kita's reforms."

In addition, this can be done while retaining power for the military."
 JAP_agrarian_expansionism: "Agrarian Expansionism"
 JAP_agrarian_expansionism_desc: "Kato's agrarian expansionism represents a merger of two previously hostile currents of Nohonshugi. The main ideologue of this movement was Kato Kanji. Kato, an educator who founded the 'Japan National Higher School', focused his ideology on the 'spirit of the farmer'. He identified this spirit with the 'Yamato spirit' and considered it true Japanese spirituality based on Shinto and the worship of kami deities. Kato believed that this spirit was destroyed by capitalism and urbanization in Japan itself. His solution was twofold: first, to solve the problem of Japan's 'surplus population' and land shortage by exporting farmers to Manchuria. Second, to create a 'new farming village' in Manchuria. There, on pure, new land, far from the corrupting influence of Japanese capitalism, the 'true spirit of the farmer' could be revived and could flourish."
 JAP_introduce_protectionist_tariffs: "Introduce Protectionist Tariffs"
 JAP_introduce_protectionist_tariffs_desc: "The demand for protectionist tariffs was perhaps the only issue on which all agrarian factions converged, from Meiji bureaucrats to Showa radicals. The problem arose after Japan became a net importer of rice after 1895. The government began importing cheap colonial rice from Taiwan and then from Korea. This import led to a decline in domestic rice prices, which ruined many Japanese farmers who could not compete with it. Bureaucratic agrarians like Yokoi Tokiyoshi 'strongly advocated for measures to impose duties on rice' in 1904. Early popular Nohonshugi like Kawakami Hajime also 'opposed the free import of agricultural goods'. The government did introduce a protective tariff in 1906, but it found itself in a stalemate. It could not set tariffs too high because it needed cheap rice to feed the growing urban working class, which was necessary for industrialization and military power."
 JAP_fight_against_statism: "Fight Against Etatism"
 JAP_fight_against_statism_desc: "The main ideologues of Nohonshugi, particularly Gondo Seikyo and Tachibana Kozaburo, did not seek to support modernization; they sought to reverse it. Their goal was to restore the supposed supremacy of agriculture and protect the village community from the destructive forces of capitalism, bureaucracy, and Western influence. It is possible that by adopting some of Gondo's concepts, we will be able to subdue and calm the young officers while retaining control of the government ourselves."

For them, the country's most serious social problem was rural poverty and the tenancy problem, which they believed the government did not treat attentively enough, especially compared to the privileges it granted to the Zaibatsu. This social consciousness of agricultural bureaucrats is sometimes called 'Ishigurism', after the great elder of agricultural administration, Ishiguro Tadaatsu. He was known for bringing social activists into his ministry, as well as for donating part of his salary to help tenant farmers in the 1930s. During the Great War, he and his followers instilled in the ministry a sense of responsibility for protecting small tenant farmers, and the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry is considered the most 'progressive' among other government bodies."
 JAP_restore_the_harmony_of_society: "Restore the Harmony of Society"
 JAP_restore_the_harmony_of_society_desc: "The central theme of agrarian nationalism, especially in the writings of Gondo Seikyo, was the call for the restoration of the lost harmony of society. For Gondo, this harmony was not merely a call for social peace; it was a specific political and spiritual concept he called 'Shashoku' (literally 'society'/'nation'). This was Gondo's idealized concept of the 'true' Japan. He defined it as 'the Japanese people, collectively organized into self-governing units under a single ruling institute, the Imperial Throne'. This society was organic, natural, and based on agriculture, which he claimed was 'ordained by the Sun Goddess herself'. Harmony in Shashoku stemmed from observing three 'cornerstones': 'obey the laws of heaven, depend on the goodness of the earth, and promote harmony among people'. It was a system based on 'mutual aid and coexistence'."
 JAP_abolish_the_meiji_land_tax: "Abolish the Meiji Land Tax"
 JAP_abolish_the_meiji_land_tax_desc: "No other single policy so symbolized the break with traditional Shashoku and the birth of the modern bureaucratic state as the Land Tax Reform of 1873. For agrarian ideologues like Gondo Seikyo, the abolition of this tax was synonymous with abolishing the very system it created. Within a generation of its introduction, the class of independent owner-farmers, whom agrarians considered the backbone of the nation, had shrunk, while the share of land cultivated by disenfranchised tenants had grown to nearly half of all agricultural land in Japan."
 JAP_fighting_the_extreme_influence_of_the_west: "Combating the Extraordinary Influence of the West"
 JAP_fighting_the_extreme_influence_of_the_west_desc: "Nohonshugi ideology defined itself primarily in opposition to Western values, which it believed were the poisonous source of Japan's modernization. The fight against the West was directed not so much against foreign states as against the Japanese elites who, in the agrarians' view, imported and implanted these alien ideas for their own gain. Gondo Seikyo directs his criticism at the philosophical foundations of the West, which he says were adopted by the Meiji state. He condemns the 'extremely competitive activity' that arose under 'European influence', individualism, and egoism, and he rejected 'Prussian-style nationalism' (Kokkashugi) as a foreign import fundamentally contrary to the true Japanese national essence (Kokutai). Capitalism, in this sense, was viewed not merely as an economic system but as a foreign invasion. Gondo attacked the Zaibatsu (financial cliques) as part of this alien system that colluded with the bureaucracy to exploit the people."
 JAP_return_to_ancient_traditions: "Return to Ancient Traditions"
 JAP_return_to_ancient_traditions_desc: "Agrarian nationalists use idealized history as their main weapon to criticize modernity. They argued that the Meiji bureaucracy and Zaibatsu capitalism were not an evolution but a deviation from the 'true' Japanese path. Their goal was to 'return to the preserved essence of the country's founding'. Gondo Seikyo, in particular, constructed a complex, albeit historically questionable, utopia based on his interpretation of the ancient past. He believed in the 'gradual development of good customs' (seizoku) that had been forcibly interrupted by the 'artificial schemes' of the modern state."
 JAP_elimination_of_bureaucratic_centralization: "Elimination of Bureaucratic Centralisation"
 JAP_elimination_of_bureaucratic_centralization_desc: "For Gondo Seikyo, bureaucratic centralization was not just an inefficient form of government; it was a fundamental evil, the antithesis of the Japanese national essence. His entire social theory was built on this dichotomy. Gondo contrasted two irreconcilable systems of government: the system of self-government — the ideal, 'natural' way. It consists of 'leaving the people to rule themselves, while officials merely point to precedent and serve as a good example'. This is 'natural rule'. Against it, he designated the system of bureaucratic rule — the modern evil. This is when 'officials seize control of all matters and rule the people'. Thus, the elimination of bureaucratic centralization was a prerequisite for any meaningful economic or social healing."

 JAP_reduction_of_the_state_apparatus: "Reduction of State Apparatus"
 JAP_reduction_of_the_state_apparatus_desc: "Gondo argued that the modern Meiji state stood on 'three pillars', and that to restore self-government, all three had to be destroyed. These three pillars were: the bureaucracy, the Zaibatsu (plutocrats), and the military. Unlike many other nationalists of his time, Gondo was deeply hostile to the modern military establishment. He attacked the 'military clique' for its 'political ambitions' and for bloating the army 'far beyond the economy's ability to support it'. He rejected the modern army as another form of 'militarist, Prussian nationalism'. Agrarians saw no significant difference between 'big business', 'big government', and 'big military'. For them, it was a single, monolithic, urban enemy. Gondo explicitly stated that these groups were 'intermarried' and 'united into a single group'."
 JAP_re_creation_of_the_village_community: "Re-Establishing the Village Community"
 JAP_re_creation_of_the_village_community_desc: "While Gondo's criticism focused on dismantling the bureaucratic state, his positive program focused on re-creating the idealized village community, or Kyodotai. This concept, known as Kyodoshugi (communalism), was the heart of their utopian vision. For Gondo Seikyo, his concept of Shashoku was, in essence, a corporate system of village agricultural land tenure. In this idealized community, there was no place for the modern class conflict that tore apart the villages of the 1920s. Gondo openly minimized the conflict between landlords and tenants, arguing that they were 'interdependent' and simply needed to 'set their hearts right'. His ideal was hierarchical but harmonious, based on the supposed virtues of the pre-capitalist past. He did recognize that the most effective reform in agriculture is land ownership by owner-farmers."
 JAP_implementation_of_8_rights_of_self_government: "Realisation of the Eight Rights of Self-Government"
 JAP_implementation_of_8_rights_of_self_government_desc: "While much of Gondo Seikyo's criticism focused on what he wanted to destroy (bureaucracy, capitalism), his 'eight rights of self-government' represent the most concrete plan of what he wanted to build. The implementation of this plan would lead to the 'central government practically evaporating', leaving it with only the 'ceremonial functions of the Imperial Court'."
 JAP_expansion_of_shashoku_self_government: "Expansion of Shashoku Self-Governance"
 JAP_expansion_of_shashoku_self_government_desc: "Although the community was presented as an economic model (self-sufficiency), its primary function in Nohonshugi was moral. Both Gondo and Tachibana argued that the village is the foundation of the economy. However, their main anger was directed at the moral decay caused by the West: 'egoism', 'greed', and 'competition'. The village community, by contrast, was extolled as the only source of opposing virtues: 'mutual aid' (in Gondo) and 'mutual love' (in Tachibana). Re-creating the community was thus primarily a moral imperative — a project to restore Japan's 'soul', which they believed could only be found in the soil."
 JAP_increase_the_production_of_agricultural_products: "Increase Agricultural Production"
 JAP_increase_the_production_of_agricultural_products_desc: "The early form of Nohonshugi ideology promoted increasing agricultural production. This idea, promoted by Meiji officials such as Shinagawa Yajiro and Hirata Tosuke, was essentially a pragmatic state policy. It extolled agriculture and sought to preserve and utilize its productivity to achieve the national goals of 'wealth and power'. In this model, the village served as an economic base to support industrialization. Modern Nohonshugi leaders also call for increased production, but their goals differ and are more anti-modernist and spiritual."
 JAP_the_joint_rule_of_the_emperor_and_the_people: "The Joint Rule of the Emperor and the People"
 JAP_the_joint_rule_of_the_emperor_and_the_people_desc: "Meiji ideologues placed the Emperor at the head of the modern bureaucratic state; the 1889 Constitution made him sovereign, while the bureaucracy and military ruled in his name. This created a paradox for any radical: how to attack the state without attacking the Emperor? Nohonshugi resolved this paradox by distinguishing between the Emperor and the state and claiming a direct, mystical connection between the Emperor and the people (farmers) that had been usurped by a corrupt bureaucracy. Gondo's central political theory was the 'joint rule of the Emperor and the people'. In this model, the Emperor is not the head of the bureaucratic Kokka (State); he is the supreme patriarch of the organic Shashoku. He rules in harmony with the self-governing people directly, bypassing officials and politicians. Gondo argued that the Meiji state betrayed the Emperor by inserting itself between the ruler and the people, thereby breaking the sacred bond. Thus, 'true' loyalty to the Emperor required overthrowing the bureaucracy."
 JAP_antimonopoly_legislation: "Antimonopoly Legislation"
 JAP_antimonopoly_legislation_desc: "The demand for 'antimonopoly legislation' was central to the Nohonshugi attack on capitalism. However, their concept of 'antimonopoly' was fundamentally different from Western models, such as the American populist movement. Tachibana Kozaburo explicitly called for laws 'prohibiting the monopolization and investment for private gain of resources, means of production, and financial institutions vital to society'. Gondo Seikyo went even further, attacking the very legal basis of monopoly: the 'European-style private property system' introduced by the Meiji government, which 'arbitrarily monopolized' all land and capital. This was not a modern 'antitrust' policy. The American populists they might be compared to were themselves small capitalists who wanted fair competition. Japanese radical agrarians were communalists. They opposed monopoly not because it stifled competition, but because it was inherently selfish and destroyed the Kyodotai (community). Their 'antimonopoly' stance was a demand not to ensure fairer private control, but to return all resources to communal control."
 JAP_emergency_government: "Emergency Government"
 JAP_emergency_government_desc: "The concept of an 'emergency government' was a concrete plan by Tachibana Kozaburo to transfer power after the violent overthrow of the existing regime. He believed that after the 'loyalists' (i.e., the conspirators) removed the corrupt leadership, they should 'form an emergency government composed of talented people from all sides. The function of this transitional body would be to 'initiate economic and political changes' that constituted the 'Patriotic Reform' — namely, dismantling capitalist structures and beginning the construction of Kyodotai'."

 JAP_pardon_the_anarchists_desc: ""
 JAP_patriotic_reform: "Patriotic Reform"
 JAP_patriotic_reform_desc: "The concept of 'Patriotic Reform' is central to the ideology of Tachibana Kozaburo, set out in his seminal work 'Basic Principles of Japanese Patriotic Reform'. This document was presented as lectures to young military officers in January 1932, just months before the May 15 Incident in which Tachibana and his disciples took a direct part. This reform was not a proposal for gradual policy change; it was a call for a total, spiritual, and revolutionary transformation. Tachibana argued that reform could not be achieved through debate or legislation, but only through direct action requiring qualities he defined as 'courage, sincerity, action, sacrifice, death'. The movement was to be led by a 'group of loyalists following the divine will' who were willing to 'die in the name of the great principles of patriotic reform'. Here, Tachibana consciously drew parallels with the shishi ('men of high purpose') of the 1860s who overthrew the Tokugawa shogunate."
 JAP_state_control_of_the_military_industry: "State Control of the Military Industry"
 JAP_state_control_of_the_military_industry_desc: "Tachibana Kozaburo's ideology was based on radical decentralization and anti-statism. He demanded that communities control finance, industry, and politics. However, he made one important and telling exception: the military industry. Only in the case of the military industry did he definitely advocate state control, likely because arms production was so closely linked to national defense. This exception reveals a fundamental truth about Tachibana's ideology: ultimately, his nationalism was more important than his agrarianism. His ultimate goal was not simply a peaceful rural utopia. His ultimate goal was a powerful, spiritually pure Japan capable of leading a 'world revolution' and 'crushing American power in the Pacific'. He was pragmatic enough to realize that his 'people's army' (Nohei) could not fight the United States with farm tools. It would require modern, centrally produced military equipment. Therefore, Tachibana was willing to sacrifice the pure logic of his anti-statist Jichi ideology for the higher goal of national defense and the survival of the Kokumin (people)."
 JAP_to_free_people_from_false_government: "Free the People from False Government"
 JAP_to_free_people_from_false_government_desc: "The central demand of agrarian radicals like Gondo Seikyo and Tachibana Kozaburo is to liberate the Japanese people from what they considered 'false rule'. Tachibana defined 'false rule' as the rule of a corrupt elite he considered traitors to the nation: the 'privileged classes, party politicians, Zaibatsu', and the military establishment. Tachibana also attacked 'modern Western materialistic civilization'. At the heart of Gondo's criticism lay a fundamental distinction he drew between Shashoku and Kokka. Kokka was the State — the bureaucratic apparatus, tax system, police, and military; for Gondo, it was an artificial, 'false' construct. Shashoku, by contrast, was Society or the People — the organic, ancient, and 'true' aggregate of self-governing communal villages. Thus, 'liberating the people' meant dismantling the Kokka (State) to free the Shashoku (Society)."
 JAP_tachibana_welfare_economy: "Tachibana's Welfare Economy"
 JAP_tachibana_welfare_economy_desc: "As part of his 'Patriotic Reform', Tachibana Kozaburo proposed a radical economic restructuring he called the 'welfare economy'. This system was based on a complete rejection of capitalist principles. Its main ideas were: first, human-centricity: the economy must be 'human-oriented, not product-oriented'. Production must serve human needs, not the other way around. Second, the priority of livelihood was proclaimed. The primary goal of the economy should be 'saving individual livelihoods from money-making'. It was to guarantee 'food, clothing, and shelter' for all as a basic right, not as a commodity to be bought. Third, communal planning must be implemented — the economy must be 'planned by society' — that is, by decentralized rural and urban Kyodotai — rather than by a central state or free market forces."

 JAP_own_rural_financial_institutions: "Proprietary Rural Financial Institutions"
 JAP_own_rural_financial_institutions_desc: "Nohonshugi ideologues rejected state cooperatives as merely another tool of bureaucratic control. Their 'people's' model was a 'bottom-up' response. Tachibana's model was embodied in his own 'Society of Those Who Love the Community'. It was a fully autonomous, self-governing local cooperative that handled collective purchasing, marketing, division of labor, and finance. It was a financial institution that was an expression of self-government, not state paternalism. In his national plan, Tachibana demanded that 'rural and urban communities organize financial institutions themselves'. Thus, state cooperativism was a tool of modernization designed to integrate farmers into the national economy. People's cooperativism was a tool of anti-modernization designed to protect the community from capitalism."
 JAP_regulation_by_individual_communities: "Regulation by Individual Communities"
 JAP_regulation_by_individual_communities_desc: "According to Tachibana's ideas, the economy should be 'planned by society' — that is, by decentralized rural and urban Kyodotai — and not by a central state or free market forces. This concept was a radical rejection of all existing economic models. Bureaucratic Nohonshugi supported agriculture because it was productive and profitable for the state, financing industrialization. Other popular agrarians wanted to reform capitalism to make farming profitable for farmers. Tachibana rejected the very concept of profit. His 'welfare economy' was essentially an idealized, nationalized model of subsistence farming, where the highest goal was livelihood and spiritual satisfaction through labor, not capital accumulation."

'A central government that is not based on the consensus of the people,' he declared, 'will not be able to carry out heavy political responsibilities.' But while Gondo made self-government the main goal of his political hopes, Tachibana was willing to accept parliamentarism alongside local autonomy as a means of seeking consensus."
 JAP_system_of_national_cooperative_self_government: "System of People's Co-operative Self-Government"
 JAP_system_of_national_cooperative_self_government_desc: "The 'System of People's Cooperative Self-Government', or Jichi, is the core of Gondo Seikyo's ideology. He defined it as 'the true essence of the ancient Japanese system', the complete opposite of 'bureaucratic rule'. Theoretically, Gondo's Jichi was based on his distinction between Shashoku (Society) and Kokka (State). Self-government was 'natural authority' that organically arose from 'natural groupings' of people — hamlets (buraku) and villages (mura). The Meiji state destroyed this system by usurping power from local communities and transferring it to a centralized bureaucracy."
 JAP_create_urban_kyodotai: "Create Urban Kyodotai"
 JAP_create_urban_kyodotai_desc: "Nohonshugi ideology was inherently anti-urban, viewing cities as a source of moral decay and economic parasitism. Gondo Seikyo stated that 'cities are currently in a state of twilight, where evil and confusion reign'. Tachibana Kozaburo was even harsher, describing big cities as 'parasites that destroy farming villages' by sucking away their wealth and youth. However, Tachibana was not a simple romantic calling for the complete dissolution of cities. He recognized the reality of industrial Japan. His radical solution was not to destroy cities, but to reform them by forcing them to reorganize in the image of the idealized village. He called for the creation of 'urban Kyodotai' (urban communities). Tachibana believed that eventually all citizens - even city dwellers - could become part of a unified nation across the land of brotherhood under the throne."
 JAP_patriotic_brotherhood: "Patriotic Brotherhood"
 JAP_patriotic_brotherhood_desc: "The concept of 'Patriotic Brotherhood', or Aikoku Dohoshugi, was the spiritual and emotional foundation of Tachibana Kozaburo's 'Patriotic Reform'. This ideology was not just a theory; it was developed and tested in Tachibana's personal communalist experiments: the 'Village of Brothers' he founded with his siblings, and the 'Society of Those Who Love the Community', his local cooperative. The ideological function of 'Patriotic Brotherhood' was to serve as a Japanese answer to what Tachibana considered the poisonous 'egoism' and 'materialism' of the West. He believed that only through 'mutual love and cooperation' inherent in the agrarian way of life could the Japanese people overcome class and economic divisions and unite as a whole."
 JAP_united_national_people: "A United National People"
 JAP_united_national_people_desc: "At the heart of the ideological struggle of the 1920s and 1930s lay the question of defining the nation. Nohonshugi offered a definition directly opposite to that promoted by the state. This conflict is best understood through the distinction between Kokkashugi (State Nationalism) and Kokuminshugi (People's or Ethnic Nationalism). Kokkashugi is an ideology promoted by the state, demanding loyalty to the state (bureaucracy, government, institutions). Kokuminshugi, by contrast, defined loyalty to the Kokumin (people) or 'ethno-national group'. Tachibana Kozaburo sought to create a 'united national people' unified by 'patriotic brotherhood'. This Kokumin was to be created by merging rural and urban Kyodotai. Gondo and Tachibana argued that the ruling elite (bureaucrats, politicians, Zaibatsu) had betrayed the 'united national people'."

May I now say that it is impossible for us to dream of a historic great Japan that can, with one blow, smash American power in the Pacific to smithereens, sweep the influence of the Chinese military clique from 400 million Chinese farmers, liberate India from England, force Russia to realize its errors and compel it to carry out a revolution based on the percentage of the population that farmers constitute, and bring the Germans to their feet?"

This army was not to be a reformed Imperial Army; it was to become a new force based on the ancient principle of Nohei (soldier-farmer), which the Meiji government had deliberately rejected in favor of a professional army on the Prussian model. Tachibana, like Gondo, despised the existing military establishment as just another corrupt, elitist bureaucracy. His 'people's army' was to draw its strength from other sources. He argued that soldiers and farmers are the purest bearers of 'patriotic brotherhood'. He noted that 'more than 70% of the men in the Japanese army are sons of rural villages', creating a natural alliance. He cited the 'peasant army' in China (referring to the Red Army in Jiangxi) as proof that an army based on farmers and ideology is invincible. This 'people's army' was to be a revolutionary force. It was to unite sympathetic young officers (to whom he lectured) with a radical farmer base. It would be an army loyal to the Kokumin (people) and Kokutai, not the corrupt Kokka (state)."

 JAP_cyclone_matsuoka_desc: "During his years at the Kasumigaseki (Ministry of Foreign Affairs) about twenty years ago, Matsuoka learned to distrust the bureaucratic approach of "much ado about nothing.” Diplomats were usually promoted by seniority. Young people with great talent could not reach top positions until their elders retired. This created an atmosphere in which it was customary to do only what was safe, which hindered innovation. Matsuoka also complained that Japanese diplomats know much more about foreign countries than about Japan. He admired the American system, in which non-career people were appointed to important diplomatic posts, more sensitive to the political realities of the country. In his inaugural address as Minister of Foreign Affairs, Matsuoka strongly stated his determination to make radical personnel changes. "Managers of any organization should carefully and with great interest study personnel issues,” Matsuoka said. "As vice president and head of the Mantetsu division, which employed more than 60,000 people, I paid the closest attention to personnel issues.” His experience at Mantetsu had a major impact on this personnel decision. The unpleasant events that occurred during his presidency in Mantetsu can partly be explained by his inability to deal with personnel issues. He did not want to repeat the same mistake at the Ministry of Foreign Policy."

Moscow's cooperation is still required to negotiate with the United States from a position of strength and end the war in China, the two main goals for which the Trilateral Pact was concluded. If Japan manages to reach an agreement with Moscow, this step alone will tilt the balance in favour of Japan in its other diplomatic efforts. This will free up the Kwantung Army to deploy elsewhere. Rapprochement with the Soviet Union in this case, however, does not mean a change in the basic anti-Soviet orientation of Japanese diplomacy."

Kitazawa Naokichi, a young foreign service officer who had just returned from China, was asked to present the first draft. Kitazawa said that in order to dispel the Chinese people's distrust of Japan, people like Toyama Mitsuru should be appointed as Japanese delegates for direct talks. Kitazawa's project was included in the recommendation submitted by Ichirō Ōta, Head of the First Department, Matsuoka. Ōta's own plan contained the following conditions for peace: China's recognition of Manchukuo at an appropriate time; joint defense against the Communists; withdrawal of Japanese troops from China as soon as possible; and the deployment of Japanese troops in certain areas to maintain order, but not in the Yangtze Delta area. Kitazawa's project and Ōta's plan have created an atmosphere of optimism in relations with China that Japan's basic demands will be accepted."

First, it is scientific determinism – his 'scientific analysis of war' and 'technical studies of military history' led him to the conclusion that technology (especially aviation and new energy) makes total, global war inevitable. Secondly, as a religious prophecy, his 'Nichiren eschatology' and faith in Nichiren's prophecy of a 'titanic world struggle' in the era of Mappō (the last days of the law) gave this scientific inevitability a divine meaning. The 'Final War' was thus a necessary and desirable apocalypse — an act of creative destruction that was supposed to destroy corrupt the old world and open the way for a new, unified and spiritual order."
 JAP_world_peace: "World Peace"
 JAP_world_peace_desc: "The ultimate goal of the apocalypse was "world peace." Ishiwara is, in fact, an "apocalyptic pacifist." He believes that the "Final War" will be so total and destructive (due to aviation) that it will make the war itself impossible. After this final, cleansing war, the world will finally reach its ultimate goal. It will become "united, peaceful and Buddhist", united under the spiritual guidance of the "Global Tennō" and living in the "highest culture" based on the "unity of science and religion." Ishiwara's entire radical and often violent program was, in his mind, the only way to achieve this "eternal peace"."

 JAP_Seva: "Shōwa"
 JAP_Seva_desc: "According to tradition, each emperor proclaims his own era upon ascension to the throne, to which he himself chooses a name. Hirohito, during his enthronement ceremony on 25 December 1926, gave it the name Shōwa. This term can be roughly understood as "enlightened world" or, in some interpretations, "shining Japan". In his address to the nation, the Emperor described why he chose this name: "I have visited the battlefields of the Great War in France. In the presence of such devastation, I realised the blessing of peace and the need for harmony among nations." However, in the political and military environment, many associate the name of the new era with the radical changes that are to take place in Japan, comparable to the Meiji Revolution, which clearly contradicts the emperor's words..."
 JAP_Reiva: "Reiwa"
 JAP_Heysei: "Heisei"
 JAP_resource_allocation_modifier: "Resource Allocation"
 JAP_resource_allocation_modifier_desc: "One of the fundamental problems of our country is the independence of the Imperial Army and the Imperial Navy from any other authority in the country except the emperor, whom they also sometimes do not listen to. In this regard, one of the most pressing issues of any future mobilization of the economy will be the allocation of resources between the army, navy and the civilian sector. The influence of the old zaibatsu and their unwillingness to eliminate laissez-faire capitalism only exacerbate this problem, as it does not allow for the transition to an efficient allocation of resources."
 JAP_army_factionalism: "Army Factionalism"
 JAP_army_factionalism_desc: "The new era brought new trends to the military environment - officers of various stripes became more and more interested in politics, more and more competitive with each other and, most importantly, with the civilian government. When economical stagnation began, it radicalised their actions, leading to a series of coup attempts to implement their own reforms, but on the other hand, it divided the military and forced them to fight with each other, which also resulted in a series of terrorist attacks and examples of extremism among them."
 JAP_zaibatsus: "Zaibatsu"
 JAP_zaibatsus_desc: "Large family-owned financial and industrial conglomerates, history of many of which began in the 17th century. Although they helped Japan undergo modernisation during the Meiji Restoration, these days their existence is frowned upon by many common people and elites due to the economic turmoil of recent years. They are being replaced by the "new Zaibatsu," which are already much more aimed to modern trends, but the "old" ones still continue to play an important role economically and sometimes politically."

 JAP_limited_zaibatsus: "Limited Zaibatsu"
 JAP_gekokujo: "Gekokujō"
 JAP_gekokujo_desc: "A Japanese word for someone in a lower position overthrowing someone in a higher position, using military or political might, seizing power. It is variously translated as "the lower rules the higher" or "the low overcomes the high." In recent years, militaries at all levels have become active in the practice of gekokujō, such as assassination attempts on politicians or foreigners, attempted coups d'etat, and sometimes even in the unauthorised seizure of Manchurian territory in China. Failure to put an end to this military freedom could have irreparable damage to the country.§!\n\n§9An excessive level of insubordination in the military would lead to their attempts to act independently in China and Asia, and will also allow them to influence the civilian government in Tokyo by intimidation and exploiting legal loopholes in the Meiji Constitution.§!\n\n\n§R To remove $JAP_gekokujo$, it is necessary to reduce the Insubordination Level to zero.§!"
 JAP_Amur_River_Society: "Kokuryūkai"
 JAP_Amur_River_Society_desc: "The secret organisation Kokuryūkai traces its history back to 1901, when it was founded by Japanese nationalist Ryōhei Uchida, originally to resist Russian influence in Asia. The name reflected its meaning - to drive the Russians beyond the Amur River, which in Chinese is called the Black Dragon River. After the organisation's spectacular successes during the Russo-Japanese War, high-ranking government officials, cabinet ministers and members of the state security agencies began to join the organisation. The organisation published a number of newspapers and magazines to promote its views. Kokuryūkai periodicals were published and distributed in China and Korea, and in English as well. "Amur Bulletin" received support, including financial support, from a number of Japanese corporations and large firms, as well as banks and trading houses. The Amur River Society organised a school for training in professional espionage, whose agents were engaged in intelligence on the actions of the Russian Empire and worked against it in Russia, Manchuria, Korea and China. With the direct assistance of Kokuryūkai, gangs of Chinese militarists (the most famous of whom was Zhang Zuolin) were created in north-eastern China to fight Russian and Soviet influence. Following the pan-Asian ideas it preached, the Kokuryūkai provided financial and other assistance to revolutionaries in East Asia, such as Sun Yat-sen in China and Emilio Aguinaldo in the Philippines. The organisation was also in close contact with various Buddhist organisations and sects in Asian countries. In recent years, the Amur River Society's agent networks have enveloped almost the entire world, operating in Turkey, Morocco, Ethiopia, South-east Asia, South America, Europe and the United States, among others."

 NW_JAP_looser.0.t: "Totalitarianism is a Moral Bankrupt"
 NW_JAP_looser.0.d: "The totalitarian idea that has captured the minds of most politicians of our country in recent years in the course of the real test - total war. And though it sounds paradoxical, this test proved that totalitarianism could not cope with such a total war. Now it is time for it to leave the political scene and give way to other ideologies. To do this, the first thing we need to do is to amend the Meiji constitution to ensure that such experiments are not repeated."
 NW_JAP_looser.0.a: "Democracy Rises from Oblivion!"
 NW_JAP_looser.1.t: "Reneissance of Parliamentary Parties"
 NW_JAP_looser.1.d: "The Imperial Rule Assistance Association has become a vivid testimony to the unsustainability of the idea of a one-party state - now it is time to destroy it in order to continue on the path of democratisation of Japan. Since the original members of the Association were almost all members of the old parliamentary parties, they are now going to recreate them, but under new names. Thus, Rikken Seiyūkai will now be called the Conservative Party, Rikken Minseitō - the Progressive Party, and Shakai Taishuto - the Social Democratic Party. Nakano's supporters, on the other hand, took the name Toho Jikai."
 NW_JAP_looser.1.a: "The Experiment is Obviously a Failure"
 NW_JAP_looser.2.t: "Victory of Rikken Minseitō"
 NW_JAP_looser.2.d: ""The National Diet elections are looking more and more like a man stepping on a rake, then stepping back and stepping on it again"- such a sarcastic comment was received on the results of the parliamentary elections in the Asahi Shimbun newspaper. The Rikken Minseitō party won the election, as it had won several previous elections in a row. However, political elites were reluctant to trust its leader to run the country - and perhaps that is what brought Japan to where it is today."
 NW_JAP_looser.2.a: "Well this time it looks like the party has a chance to form a cabinet..."
 NW_JAP_looser.3.t: "Victory of the Progressive Party"
 NW_JAP_looser.3.d: ""The National Diet elections are looking more and more like a man stepping on a rake, then stepping back and stepping on it again" - such a sarcastic comment was Victory of Rikken Minseitōreceived on the results of the parliamentary elections in the Asahi Shimbun newspaper. The Progressive Party, which is made up of members of the former Rikken Minseitō, which has won a majority in the last few elections, won this election as well. However, political elites were reluctant to entrust its leader with running the country - and it is possible that this is what has brought Japan to where it is today."
 NW_JAP_looser.3.a: "But now, in a modified form, the party has a chance to form a cabinet!"
 NW_JAP_looser.4.t: "Tanzan Ishibashi"
 NW_JAP_looser.4.d: "Despite all the repression and arrests of many scholars, there remained one unbreakable bastion of free speech: the journals Oriental Economic Review and the English-language Oriental Economist. Their editor-in-chief was Tanzan Ishibashi, a philosophy graduate of Waseda University who began writing for the journals in the late 1910s, commenting on the Japanese government's financial policies.\n\nDuring his years as editor, Ishibashi's scathing, liberal commentary on almost every significant event was the subject of almost every editorial. Although Ishibashi was widely known as a liberal, government officials highly valued his economic expertise and constantly called upon him as an independent expert and advisor to the government on economic issues.\n\nUntil the last moment, he resisted the ideology of militarism, totalitarianism, and colonialism. Instead, he advocated a "Little Japan" policy that favoured abandoning Manchuria and Japanese colonies in order to refocus efforts on Japan's own economic and cultural development. Despite these ultra-liberal values, his expert ability allowed him to continue to speak his mind even in the harshest of times.\n\nRikken MinseitōNow, after his words about the need to abandon colonies and the dangers of military influence on politics and expansion into China were confirmed in their truest sense, Tanzan decided to step out of journalism and expert judgement and into politics. To do so, he agreed to join and lead Rikken Minseitō, as its positions are the closest to Tanzan's own."
 NW_JAP_looser.4.a: "Welcome back, Ishibashi-san!"
 NW_JAP_looser.5.t: "Minor Japanism"
 NW_JAP_looser.5.d: "Tanzan Ishibashi was the editor-in-chief of the journals  became an opportunity during the years of repression for many other journalists, academics and analysts to express their thoughts without fear of being arrested by the security services for doing so. This was done thanks to the fact that their articles remained anonymous. Ishibashi's own moral and expert authority allowed him to publish all this and not get his journals banned."
 NW_JAP_looser.5.a: "The state should always have a stop valve, Ishibashi is it."
 NW_JAP_looser.6.t: "Mass Pardon"
 NW_JAP_looser.6.d: "Today the Emperor, on the advice of the Prime Minister, issued a decree pardoning many political prisoners, including scientists, cultural figures and even some radical politicians. There was no cancellation of the Peace Preservation Law, but now this 'gesture on the part of the emperor' will make the security services think twice when they want to arrest some other 'unreliable person'.."
 NW_JAP_looser.6.a: "Truly the prime minister we deserve..."
 NW_JAP_looser.7.t: "Resumption of the Activities of Kingorō Hashimoto"
 NW_JAP_looser.7.d: "The relentless Colonel Hashimoto, who had been disturbing the constitutional order of the state since the early 30s, has resumed his activities again - his organisation, practically a personal army, is beginning to swell dramatically with a large number of new supporters from among the demobilised military who cannot find themselves in civilian life. If we don't try to turn the situation around, with the low stability and high popularity of his ideas, he will succeed in overthrowing the current government and installing one that will not take such radical action against the army."
 NW_JAP_looser.7.a: "We'll keep an eye on it."
 NW_JAP_looser.8.t: "Mass Rallies in the Streets"
 NW_JAP_looser.8.d: "Today, discontent with the government has taken to the streets as many politicians feared. The main problem is that these are now ex-military men who can handle weapons and are willing to take risks. They are the ones Hashimoto is betting on - the tension, instability, and clashes on the streets have been there for a long time, but now it has erupted into a mass protest demanding the resignation of the government."
 NW_JAP_looser.8.a: "We have to try to suppress them!"
 NW_JAP_looser.9.t: "Hashimoto's Coup"
 NW_JAP_looser.9.d: "The government's attempted suppression of mass rallies throughout the capital led to more riots and the eventual storming of the parliament building and other government offices. The protesters were led by Hashimoto's men, who demanded the formation of a government led by Shūmei Ōkawa, a close friend of Kingorō since before the war." 
 NW_JAP_looser.9.a: "There's nothing left to do but agree to his demands."
 NW_JAP_looser.10.t: "Konoe and his Friends"
 NW_JAP_looser.10.d: "Unexpectedly for many, Konoe behaved graciously towards many of those convicted in political cases in the 1930s: as military conspirators, ultra-nationalist politicians and even communists (convicted under the Peace Protection Act) - most of whom have been granted amnesty today. This is hardly indicative of a move towards the abolition of the Peace Protection Act, as those who know Konoe well could have expected such an outcome - there was always room for a few communists or former Communist Party members or sympathisers in his circle of close friends."
 NW_JAP_looser.10.a: "An attempt to draw a line between past and new times."
 NW_JAP_looser.11.t: "Wrong Prediction"
 NW_JAP_looser.11.d: "For a long time, in all the texts that Ishiwara wrote and his supporters replicated, the 'Final' or 'Last' War was seen as inevitable. In a sense, the 'Final War' was supposed to be a religious war leading to the inevitable victory of Nichiren Buddhism, the desired end result. However, Ishiwara, defending Japan's unrivalled freedom of religion, insisted that he would never use the force of the state or law to suppress Christianity or Pure Land Buddhism, believing that religion would be unified through persuasion and debate. While Ishiwara and his supporters described the last war as a prerequisite for the global spread of Nichiren Buddhism, they ultimately left extremely vague how this would happen in practice. After the heavy defeat in China, a growing number of East Asian League members questioned the extent to which this war was desirable or obligatory. Today, this most radical element of the ideology of Nichirenism has finally fallen - the East Asia League now recognises pacifism, and Ishiwara himself made a statement to journalists during which he said that he 'recognises' that his prediction of a final war between Asia and the West 'was a profound conceit and actually a mistake'."
 NW_JAP_looser.11.a: "At Least, there will be peace in Japan."
 NW_JAP_looser.12.t: "The Japanese are Offering a Truce"
 NW_JAP_looser.12.d: "Diplomats of the Empire of Japan have conveyed to us, through a third country, a proposal for a possible armistice. The Japanese Government has fulfilled its purposes and does not wish to wage war with us any further.\n\nThey naturally assume that our part of our overseas colonies will be ceded to Japan or its collaborator governments as a result of the agreement."
 NW_JAP_looser.12.a: "We'll fight for this land!"
 NW_JAP_looser.12.b: "Let's make peace now."
 NW_JAP_looser.13.t: "Refusal to Negotiate"
 NW_JAP_looser.13.d: "Our peace proposal has not been heeded by our current enemies in the war. Apparently, they want to lose more territory."
 NW_JAP_looser.13.a: "Maybe then they'll agree."
 NW_JAP_looser.14.t: "Adoption of Esperanto"
 NW_JAP_looser.14.d: "The Empire of Japan has decided to adopt Esperanto as the new lingua franca for all members of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. This should strengthen the pan-Asian spirit of our countries, since not just the languages of different Asian countries differ greatly, but also the writing itself. Esperanto will thus become the universal language of communication among the nations of Asia. This gesture is very favourable on their part, as one would have expected a demand for the adoption of Japanese."
 NW_JAP_looser.14.a: "We will join the Esperantist zone of the lingua franca!"
 NW_JAP_looser.14.b: "Our country is too poor right now to spend extra money on this."
 
 NW_JAP.0.t: "Meeting at the Takaratai Restaurant"
 NW_JAP.0.d: "It is impossible to deny at this moment the tremendous successes of the Bolshevik economic program and the first five-year plan. A real threat looms over Manchuria because of the increased numbers of armored troops, aviation, and artillery now available to the Red Army.\n\n\n\n/n Colonel Kanji Ishiwara, leader of the Manchurian Military Faction and initiator of the Manchurian Incident, gathered several key officers from the Ministry of Defense and the General Staff at the Takaretai Restaurant in Tokyo. It was he who, after the recent assassination of Colonel Nagata Tetsuzan, who was the leader of the Toseiha faction and the initiator of the project of industrialization and militarization of the Japanese economy, suddenly took his place - the main mover of the project of modernization of Japanese industry and the army.\n\n\n\n It can be said that after this meeting, even the most skeptical representatives of the generals and officers in general began to agree with the far-reaching conclusions of the two colonels - the living and the dead."
 NW_JAP.0.a: "This is despite the difference in other political views of all these people"
 NW_JAP.1.t: "Five-Year Plan for Japanese and Manchurian Industries"
 NW_JAP.1.d: "After the death by katana of Colonel Nagata Tetsuzana the previous fall, Ishiwara took the even more important step of systematically planning for future war. Among the unpleasant surprises he encountered when he joined the General Staff, his discovery was that there was no coordinated study of Japan's economic potential, either government or private. In addition, the army lacked the expertise to conduct such a survey. He took on such a task, which entailed processing a vast sea of statistical data into clear budgetary and administrative proposals and assuming responsibility for economic planning, and formed his own think tank, the Japan-Japan Association for Financial and Economic Research. He chose an old acquaintance from the Mantetsu Company - Miyazaki Masayoshi - to head the organization. Despite the fact that the Association was based in Japan, it received strong material support from Manchuria. Through the good offices of Itagaki Seishiro, who was Deputy Chief of Staff of the Kwantung Army at the end of 1935, Mantetsu President Yosuke Matsuoku was persuaded to allocate half of the Association's budget of two million yen from company funds. The other half was secretly supplied by the General Staff itself."
 NW_JAP.1.a: "And who is Miyazaki?"
 NW_JAP.2.t: "The Miyazaki Group"
 NW_JAP.2.d: "Mr. Miyazaki is an interesting figure. He was born in Ishikawa Prefecture and was sent as a student to study in Russia just before the Great War. In Moscow during the revolution, he became interested in Marxist theory and the contradictions of capitalism, though without any obvious political leanings in that direction. He returned to Japan to work at Mantetsu, but in the second half of the twenties was again in Moscow to study Soviet economic planning, the general direction and possibilities of which apparently interested him deeply. In the thirties, returning to Japan as head of the research department of the Mitsui Bank, he acquired a solid reputation as an analyst and planner. In doing so, however, he found himself little connected to a group of so-called "reformist bureaucrats" with similar political views to his own. Despite this, Ishiwara's brain trust ended up with just such a shortened name, the 'Miyazaki Group'."
 NW_JAP.2.a: "We'll keep an eye on this man"
 NW_JAP.3.t: "Opening of the National Parliament Building"
 NW_JAP.3.d: "For the first 50 years of its existence, the Sejm met in various temporary premises, because for a long time the government could not decide what form the building built especially for this purpose should take. The first projects appeared already in the 1880s, but they were designed by German architects, which caused rejection from the majority of the public, demanding to get rid of "international" architecture for such an important symbol of Japan. In 1898, the famous American architect Ralph Adams Cram proposed a more "oriental" design of the building with tiled roofs and a large wall and gate enclosure. However, this design was rejected after the fall of Ito Hirobumi, who was the main proponent of the plan. The next two temporary structures died under similar circumstances, in 1890 and 1925, from fires caused by poor electrical wiring. As early as 1910, the Ministry of Finance set up a commission in an attempt to take control of the new parliament building project, as the Ministry of the Interior was clearly not up to the task. Prime Minister Katsura Taro led the commission, which recommended that the new building should emulate the Italian Renaissance architectural style. This recommendation was criticized by many who felt the choice was too arbitrary.\n\n\nIn 1918, the ministry sponsored a public design competition, and 118 designs were submitted for the new building. The first prize winner, Watanabe Fukuzo, came up with a design where the building ended in a "pyramid," reflecting modern hybrid architecture than purely European or Asian designs. Construction began in 1920, but was monstrously delayed by the Kanto earthquake and financial crises."
 NW_JAP.3.a: "But today, we can finally open a permanent parliament building!"
 NW_JAP.4.t: "A Message to All Citizens"
 NW_JAP.4.d: ""- -...He played a central role in the organization of the nation as an unbroken emperor of unbroken lineage. Today the world stands at the apex of historical change, with the collapse of order and the rise of disasters. It is a mission, to eliminate the idea of "constitutional politics, which can be interpreted as the politics of political party conflict," which is an "afterglow of Western thought," and to "unite all people according to the spirit of unity." All political parties will soon wake up..... and if even some idiots neglect it, the day will come when the existing political parties will be crushed by the iron rule of history. And that day is certainly not far off.\n\n\nThis proclamation was read by thousands of people across the country today. It was authored by retired Navy colonel and member of the House of Peers Sanetaka Ichijo, who worked closely with renowned ultranationalist ideologue Mitsura Toyama and Admiral Eisuke Yamamoto."
 NW_JAP.4.a: "How many more of these nonsensical proclamations will there be?"
 NW_JAP.5.t: "Anti-Communist Defense Group"
 NW_JAP.5.d: "Representatives of the One Party Movement continue to self-organize: today one of them, Tamakichi Nakamizo, together with his supporters, announced the formation of the so-called Anti-Communist Defense Group. Despite its name, it is believed to be primarily aimed at establishing totalitarian rule in the country and getting rid of parliamentary politics. Its leader, Nakamizo, is associated with many old political adventurers and conspirators. His friends include many current members of the Diet, and some even suggest that he is in the entourage of the powerful and ambitious Prince Konoe."
 NW_JAP.5.a: "We'll keep an eye on them"
 NW_JAP.6.t: "The Death of Eiichi Baba"
 NW_JAP.6.d: "One of the most important proponents of the "national defense state" project, renowned finance expert Baba Eiichi died today of a myocardial infarction. He was famous for many important actions in various positions in government, from seeking compromises between political parties and factions in parliament to important efforts to improve the financial situation in rural areas after the onset of the economic crisis."
 NW_JAP.6.a: "It's a blow to the state...national defense"
 NW_JAP.7.t: "Tōhōkai Creation"
 NW_JAP.7.d: "The radical Kokumin Dōmei party, which was formed in 1932 by former Interior Minister Adachi Kenzo from members of the Rikken Minsaito party, has itself begun to disintegrate after the last election. As recently as last year, some Kokumin Dōmei members returned to the Minsateito, and today one of the party's leaders, Seigo Nakano, stopped agreeing with Kenzo's views and announced that he and his supporters were leaving Kokumin Domei and forming a new party, Tōhōkai. Another important Kokumin Dōmei leader, Akira Kazami, also announced his withdrawal from the party."
 NW_JAP.7.a: "Such leaders can't live in the same party."
 NW_JAP.8.t: "Kazushige Ugaki's Illness."
 NW_JAP.8.d: "Medical teams began arriving at the Prime Minister's residence in the evening. Kazushige Ugaki is ill. At first it seemed that hospitalization could have been avoided, but for the additional safety of the prime minister's health, the consilium decided to hospitalize him in order to conduct a full examination and closely monitor the patient's condition.\n\nThis is exactly what the prime minister himself expected, so he had a plan for it. At least temporarily, he would retire. In doing so, the general advised the emperor to appoint a general from Ugaki's entourage as prime minister so as not to destroy the system of keeping the military out of power."
 NW_JAP.8.a: "Get well soon, General!"
 NW_JAP.9.t: "Ugaki has been Treated."
 NW_JAP.9.d: "General Ugaki has fully recovered from his illness. The unnecessary reassurance in the form of hospitalization was useful - Ugaki gained new strength for further actions in politics."
 NW_JAP.9.a: "The situation has stabilized"
 NW_JAP.10.t: "The Arrest of the Communist Academy"
 NW_JAP.10.d: "A Shizuoka Shimbun newspaper journalist arrested two weeks ago gave his testimony during interrogation. According to him, two groups of people, about 60 in total, had established a communist cell to educate people in Marxist ideas, similar to organizations that existed within the Soviet Union and in other countries with the support of the Comintern.\n\nThis group includes 32 scholars and researchers who participated in the writing of " Lecture on the History of the Development of Japanese Capitalism," a work that began an active debate in the political left between proponents of the two views of Japanese history - whether or not it had already passed the stage of bourgeois-democratic revolution.\n\nThe remaining members of the group are members of various leftist cultural organizations: writers and filmmakers."
 NW_JAP.10.a: "They should be arrested immediately!"
 NW_JAP.11.t: "Establishment of the Japan Proletarian Party"
 NW_JAP.11.d: "Kanjū Katō, elected as a deputy from leftist workers' organizations in the 1936 election, suggested that Mosaburō Suzuki, founder of the Japan Labour-Farmer Party, join forces. Both had long been known as fighters against the country's growing militarism. Previous attempts to create a mass left-wing party had failed - either they could not gain popularity or were thwarted by the government. Katō Kanjū was chosen as the head of the new party, as the party itself was claimed to be the "political wing of the labor movement" and Katō is the chairman of the left-wing trade union federation. Moreover, the party proclaims as one of its tasks "the establishment of a Popular Front for the struggle against fascism and war in Japan." The successful practice of such broad political coalitions of left-wing forces around the world seems to have reached Japan."
 NW_JAP.11.a: "Let's see what comes out this time"
 NW_JAP.12.t: "Rumors about the Popular Front"
 NW_JAP.12.d: "The leaders of the Japan Proletarian Party are thinking of forming a Popular Front against war with China - for this purpose, they have offered the head of the party Shakai Taishūtō, who has much greater popularity to form a coalition. And this is what poses the greatest danger if they suddenly agree with the arguments of the Japan Proletarian Party. In this situation, we can use the Peace Preservation Law to arrest all the overly radical leftist politicians."
 NW_JAP.12.a: "That's what we're gonna do"
 NW_JAP.13.t: "Popular Front Incident"
 NW_JAP.13.d: "Katō Kanjū and other members of the Japan Proletarian Party were among the 400 arrested as a result of the "Popular Front Incident" (Yamakawa Hitoshi, Arahata Kanson, Minobe Ryokichi), and the party itself was banned. The prosecutor's office officially declared that the Japan Proletarian Party was engaged in the dissemination of "anti-war ideas" at the behest of the Comintern, its final goal was "to change the state system of Japan through communist revolution," and those arrested were "active on the basis of the Comintern Popular Front line"."
 NW_JAP.13.a: "Repression is gaining momentum"
 NW_JAP.14.t: "The Popular Front's Second Incident"
 NW_JAP.14.d: "Today, additional arrests were made in the Popular Front case - 38 professors from Tokyo Imperial University, who were involved in teaching economics, were put behind bars. However, this incident is already regarded with disbelief by many, as they suspect that the arrests, which occurred very late, are related to the personal proceedings of university employees, some of whom were informants for the intelligence services."
 NW_JAP.14.a: "Is the situation getting out of control?"
 NW_JAP.15.t: "A Brutal Murder in Oga District"
 NW_JAP.15.d: "This morning at a hotel in Tokyo's Oga district, the mutilated body of a man was found in one of the rooms - his genitals were missing. The police found out rather quickly that the murdered man was Kichizō Ishida, the 42-year-old owner of the Yoshidaya fish restaurant. In addition, the phrase "We, Sada and Kichi Ishida, are alone" was written in blood on his left thigh as well as on a sheet. Also, a hieroglyph meaning the name "Sada" was carved on his left hand.\n\nIt was reported from the hotel management that he was staying here with prostitute Sada Abe, who was the last person to see him until he left the hotel at 8am, telling the staff not to disturb Ishida.\n\nSuch circumstances led to the story being picked up by newspapers and journalists, which had already become national news - literally causing panic across the country as frantic people began searching for the murder suspect. Police have received reports of sightings of Abe from various cities, and one false sighting nearly caused a crush in the Ginza neighborhood. In reference to the recent failed coup in Tokyo - the February 26 incident, the crime was satirically named the "May 18 Incident"."
 NW_JAP.15.a: "Who could have committed such a brutal crime?"
 NW_JAP.16.t: "The Killer's been Found"
 NW_JAP.16.d: "The medical examination concluded that Ishida had been killed by strangulation, and that he had lost his genitals afterward. The search for the killer continued until the police arrived at a hotel in the Shinagawa district where a suspicious girl with a strange name was staying.\n\n- Don't be so formal, - she told them, - you're looking for Sada Abe, right? Well, that's me. I'm Sada Abe.\n\nHowever, the police were not convinced they had found their target, whereupon the girl showed Ishida's genitals as evidence. No further corroboration was needed. Abe was arrested and interrogated for eight sessions. When asked why she cut off Ishido's genitals, she said, "Because I couldn't take his head or body with me. I wanted to take the part of him that gave me the most vivid memories." The officer conducting the interrogation was struck by Abe's behavior when asked why she killed Ishido. "Immediately she became agitated, and her eyes flashed strangely in some way." Her answer was as is: "I loved him so much, I wanted him to be all for me. But since we weren't husband and wife while he was alive, he could be held by other women. I knew that if I killed him no other woman could touch him anymore, so I killed him....."
 NW_JAP.16.a: "God, What a Crazy Story"
 NW_JAP.17.t: "Sada Abe's trial"
 NW_JAP.17.d: "By 5 a.m., crowds were already gathering outside the courthouse to attend. The judge presiding over the trial admitted to being sexually aroused by some of the details surrounding the trial, but made sure that the proceedings were conducted with the utmost seriousness. Abe's statement before sentencing began, "What I regret most about this incident is that I have been misunderstood - as some kind of sexual pervert... I have never had a man in my life like Ishido who loved and slept with without taking money, but none of them made me feel the way I felt about him." Abe was convicted of murder and mutilation of a corpse. Although the prosecution demanded ten years and Abe claimed she wanted the death penalty, she was actually sentenced to only six years in prison.\n\nThe police report of Abe's interrogation and confession became a national bestseller this year. When details of the crime were made public, rumors spread that Ishido's penis was of extraordinary big size. However, the police officer who questioned the killer after his arrest denied this, saying, "Ishido's was just average. She told me: 'Size does not make a man in bed. The technique and his desire to give me pleasure was what I liked."\n\nThe person most affected by the story (not counting the murdered man) was Goro Omiya, Abe's first lover, a professor and banker who had hoped to become a member of the Seimas, but whose political career was naturally ruined after journalists published all the details of the story in the newspapers."

 NW_JAP.18.t: "The First Anniversary of Hachiko's Death"
 NW_JAP.18.d: "Hachiko was born on November 10, 1923 in the Japanese prefecture of Akita. A farmer decided to give the puppy to Professor Hidesaburo Ueno, who worked at Tokyo Imperial University. The professor gave the puppy the name Hachiko - from the Japanese words "hachi" and "ko", the second meaning attachment or dependence, and the first because the dog was the professor's eighth dog.\n\nAs Hachiko grew older, he followed his owner everywhere he went. Professor would go to the city every day for work, so Hachiko would first walk him to the entrance of Shibuya Station and then return at 3 p.m. to meet his master. On May 21, 1925, a professor at the university had a stroke. Doctors could not save his life, and he never returned home. Hachiko was eighteen months old at the time. That day he never waited for his master, but he began to come to the station every day, patiently waiting for him until late in the evening. He spent the night on the porch of the professor's house.\n\nDespite attempts to place the dog in the homes of the professor's friends and relatives, he invariably kept returning to the station. Local shopkeepers and railroad workers fed Hachiko, admiring his persistence. The dog became famous throughout Japan in 1932 after an article published in one of the largest newspapers in Tokyo entitled "A loyal old dog awaits the return of his owner, who died seven years ago". The story won the hearts of the Japanese people, and curious people started coming to Shibuya Station to see the dog.\n\nApril 21, 1934 Hachiko was erected a monument, at the opening of which he personally attended. But exactly one year ago, the faithful dog died, he was found not far from the station - the autopsy showed that he had cancer in the last stage. It shocked people then. Today, on the first anniversary of his death, a large and diverse crowd gathered at Shibuya Station to honor his memory."
 NW_JAP.18.a: "Amazing Story"
 NW_JAP.19.t: "Genro's Retirement"
 NW_JAP.19.d: "The last genrō of Saionji Kinmochi decided to retire after serving the state for a long time - Kinmochi had been associated with high politics for almost his entire life, starting as far back as the Meiji Revolution. His most important role was when he himself was prime minister, but equally important was his work as a genrō, especially when he was the last remaining genrō after 1924, as he had to advise the emperor on the appointment of a new prime minister.\n\nThe last few years have proved that with the onset of old age (Kinmochi is over 85 years old) he is no longer able to cope with his role - political instability has reached a level that the country has probably never experienced before. Realizing this, the genrō decided to retire from all government posts, thus eliminating the very institution of the genrōrat and going to live a quiet life on his estate."
 NW_JAP.19.a: "He may have failed to realize all his plans, but it's too late now"

 NW_JAP.20.d: "Death took another of our famous admirals, Suetsugu Nobumasa. He will be remembered in history as a supporter of the development of the submarine fleet and the training of crews for harsh weather conditions, as well as a staunch anti-communist."
 NW_JAP.20.a: "Farewell, Admiral"
 NW_JAP.21.t: "Why is Saito Silent?"
 NW_JAP.21.d: "Despite the fact that a full-scale war with the Republic of China has begun, many newspaper readers and people who follow politics closely wonder why Rikken Minseitō MP Saito Takao, a well-known critic of militarism, is silent. People write letters to him, who knows his address, and to newspapers and other deputies. To stem this flow of incomprehensible cries, an announcement was made in several metropolitan newspapers by Rikken Minseitō party members and close friends of Saito that he is now in recovery from a suspected stroke, since he unluckily stumbled and fell on the stairs a few months ago. However, he continues to keep a close eye on the situation in the world and the country as he prepares to return to his regular activities."
 NW_JAP.21.a: "People respect Saito"
 NW_JAP.22.t: "Saito's Anti-War Speech"
 NW_JAP.22.d: "The elderly Saito Takao once again went to the Seimas podium to make his speech. The head of the party, Machida Chūji, tried to prevent him from speaking when he learned of the content of the speech, but he could do nothing - party discipline was already too low. Another speech once again stretched on for long, shrill minutes.\n\nThe main points of the speech were as follows: the situation with the Chinese incident and ways out of it, does the current government understand exactly what is the best way to deal with it; secondly, what is the content of the so-called construction of a new order in East Asia; thirdly, in view of the history of wars in the world, can it be achieved world peace in addition to peace in the East; fourthly, a few questions about the Chinese governments in the territories controlled by our army; Fifth, a warning to the current Cabinet by discussing the government's responsibility for the start of the Chinese incident.\n\nThe room was quiet during the speech, with only a few cries from small and medium-sized groups, the rest of the room was quiet and there was occasional applause. "But there seemed to be a vague unease in the room," were the comments Saito made to reporters after the meeting. Saito recited almost his entire speech from memory - he had devoted several weeks to creating and memorizing it."
 NW_JAP.22.a: "Saito is relevant as ever"
 NW_JAP.23.t: "Consequences of Speech"
 NW_JAP.23.d: "After the speech, the Jikyoku Doshikai and Shakai Taishuto parties made a statement that Saito's speech offended the purpose of the Japanese Empire's movement in Asia. This was answered by Prime Minister [ROOT.GetLeader], The Minister of Finance, the Minister of Internal Affairs and Communications, but Saito was not satisfied with their answers. In addition, the Minister of War did not respond, although this was what the MP was most looking forward to.\n\nThis is because the Army's position was divided. The Minister of War was on the side of those who really thought that the Chinese incident had gone on long enough. So he didn't answer anything officially, but after the meeting he personally told Saito, "I'm impressed. You're pretty good at what you say." But the head of the Political Affairs Department of the East Asian Development Council and the head of the Military Affairs Bureau, who listened to the speech as members of the government looked at each other with wry smiles and said quietly, "Saito would say something like that."\n\nIn addition, Matsutoshi Koyama, Speaker of the House of Representatives and member of the Rikken Minseitō, spoke, saying: "There is no one who knows the purpose of war in the spiritual movement." He also wrote it down and gave it to Misao Ōki, the chief secretary of the House of Representatives, and ordered him to secretly delete about two-thirds of the entire speech, or about 10,000 words, that were particularly critical of the military. Although Ōki resisted, he finally conceded to Koyama."
 NW_JAP.23.a: "The scandal is gaining ground"
 NW_JAP.24.t: "The Split in Rikken Minseitō"
 NW_JAP.24.d: "When the attack on Saito began, the Minseito Party leadership hastily worked with the army to try to resolve the situation by removing the content of Saito's speech from the stenographic transcript. Saito visited Chairman Koyama with senior party members and his friends and said: "If the army is unhappy with the content of the speech, why didn't War Minister Shunroku Hata respond to it?".\n\nHowever, because of the delay in the removal procedure, some local newspapers published all of Saito's anti-war speeches the next day, and the anti-war speeches in the Japanese parliament became known all over the world. Right now, reports about it are being printed in Chinese and American newspapers.\n\nRikken Minseitō members, seeing that the military and others continued to attack Saito, tried to force Saito to "voluntarily resign," but he flatly refused, suggesting that they "accept it as inevitable." As a result, it was decided to send Saito Takao to a Disciplinary Committee headed by the Seimas Speaker."
 NW_JAP.24.a: "Let's see where this goes"
 NW_JAP.25.t: "Meeting of the Disciplinary Committee"
 NW_JAP.25.d: "Discussions have begun on Saito Takao's act within the parties as a vote is expected on his expulsion from the current House of Representatives caucus. The Nakajima Faction of the Rikken Seiyūkai Party, Jikyoku Dōshikai and Shakai Taishūtō have united in support of punishment, while the majority of the Kuhara Seiyūkai Faction appears to be against the punishment. The Minseitō Party is holding a secret meeting of representatives to discuss the issue, but the majority of the party is in opposition, and it doesn't look like this will be easily resolved due to the hot debate over the attacks on the leaders.\n\nIn his defense before the committee, Saito described the process that led to the question and speech and the general content of the speech, and then broke down the seven reasons for punishment presented by the Seiyūkai Nakajima faction, one by one, with counterarguments. In addition, the complainant was completely indignant and could not respond to a single word of the accused deputy.\n\nVoting followed, the results of which were distributed as follows. There were 167 empty seats in the Seimas, or less than a third of lawmakers decided not to attend. The Rikken Minseitō Party ended the party debate in favor of exclusion, but Kyujiro Okazaki, close to Saito, opposed exclusion and left the party. He was the only Democrat to vote against it. Of the remaining 170 members, 69, or more than 40%, were absent or abstained. In the Rikken Seiyūkai, 27 of the 71 members of the Kuhara faction abstained or were absent, and 5, the largest number of any faction, were opposed. 16 of 97 members of the Nakajima faction, which is close to the military, and 4 of 10 members of the Konko faction abstained or were absent. Of the 34 members of the pro-war Shakai Taishūtō party, 10 abstained or were absent. 5 of 30 members of the Jikyoku Doshikai abstained. Of the 10 independent members, 1 objected and 7 abstained. The result of the vote was a total of 303 votes, 296 in favor and 7 against, and the expulsion was confirmed."
 NW_JAP.25.a: "Goodbye, Mr. Saito"
 NW_JAP.26.t: "Party Collapse"
 NW_JAP.26.d: "In comments to journalists, Saito said that he was not upset by the events, as he is confident that he is valued by the electorate and will be able to return to work in the Seimas after the next elections. The consequences for the parliamentary parties were much more severe. This incident clearly showed within each of the parties, not, as it seemed before, only within Rikken Xuekai. Moreover, the tendency to "pact with the military" drove the democratic Rikken Minseitō to the point where it expelled its member from parliament rather than supporting him. This severely undermined her credibility with her constituents and their hopes for parliamentarianism. Shakai Taishūtō was finally overrun by her nationalist faction willing to cooperate with the military - Hisashi Aso achieved his goal and emerged above party founder Abe Isoo, who had virtually withdrawn from political activity. But most importantly, the final vote showed how many members of parliament were unwilling in principle to choose between punishing Saito and supporting him, apparently fearful of threats to them from radicals."

Lu (or Jiao-liao) is a nationality living in Shandong and belonging to the Han Chinese. The idea of their own state for this people was defended by one of the officers of the Manchurian army Date Junnosuke, a Japanese, ronin, politician and adventurer, who had long been engaged in various conspiracies mainly in the territory of China, but he was also known for having shot two of his abusers who attacked him when he was still at school. In Japan he was closely associated with radicals such as Shūmei Ōkawa, Ikki Kita and Onisaburo Deguchi. After moving to China, he became a close friend of one of the famous and terrible warlords as Zhang Zongchang, and even made a brotherhood pact with him in 1929 and changed his name to Zhang Zongyuan."

The most likely suspects - agents of counterintelligence of the Kuomintang, who allegedly received information about secret negotiations between Tang and the Japanese military in order to head the puppet government of China. The assassins managed to get right into Tang's house thanks to his predilection for collecting antiques. Having acquired very rare porcelain vases from the Song era, they offered them to the famous politician. It was during the deal that the unfortunate hit came. The Kuomintang government has already pledged to compensate the family for the funeral expenses and submit Tang's lifetime achievements to the State Committee for the Compilation of Official History, but the public will still be outraged by the blatant murder."

It is said that Kita called for abandoning hopes of national reconstruction by a coup in favor of a politically sound reorganization centered on proper relations with China. Nakano was accompanied by his regular advisers and was able to interview Chiang Kai-shek early in the new year - it was not exactly their first meeting.

 NW_JAP.50.d: "Despite all attempts to resolve the German Ambassador's conflict between our countries, the Chinese leadership clearly showed that they were unwilling to go for a peaceful solution to the incident. They definitively refused Trautmann's services, stating that they would not negotiate."
 NW_JAP.50.a: "Amazing hope for a military miracle on China's part"
 NW_JAP.51.t: "Tougher Japanese Requirements"
 NW_JAP.51.d: "Japan officially rejected the peace negotiations based on the first proposal and promised to prepare new ones within some time. In fact, the Japanese themselves warned about this development even during the discussion of the first proposals. Now the new Japanese demands look as follows:\n\n1. Diplomatic recognition of Manchukuo;\n2. Autonomy of Inner Mongolia;\n3. Termination of all anti-Japanese and anti-Manchurian policies;\n4.	Cooperation between Japan, Manchukuo and China against communism;\n5. War reparations;\n6. Demilitarized Zones in North China and Inner Mongolia\n7.

 NW_JAP.52.t: "Resolution of the China Incident"
 NW_JAP.52.d: "The other day an Imperial Conference was held with the Emperor present. Japanese ministers and military commanders discussed how to deal with Trautmann's mediation. The navy did not have a strong opinion because the current war was mainly the army's business. The Army asked to end the war diplomatically on milder terms because its main objective was war with the Red Army in the Soviet Far East and to fight it it was necessary to avoid an endless war of attrition in China. The Foreign Minister, however, strongly disagrees with the Army. According to him, there is no hope for Troutman's mediation because of the great difference of opinion between China and Japan."

In a statement, he said: "We will not deal with the Nationalist government" and ordered the Ambassador to China, Shigeru Kawagoe, to return to Japan. In response, the Nationalist government also decided to summon the ambassador to Japan, Xu Shiyin, back home. As a result, diplomatic relations between the two countries were severed and the Japanese government essentially voluntarily refused to negotiate with the Kuomintang government. Moreover, [FROM.GetLeader] said he hoped for the establishment of "a new Chinese government based on the overthrow of the government of the [CHI.GetLeader]», and then the war could be over. Thus, the attempt to establish negotiations made by the German Ambassador to China, Oskar Trautmann, with the support of some Japanese and Chinese representatives, is thwarted."

 NW_JAP.54.d: "The failed coup attempts in 1931 by the Sakurakai, a secret society of the Imperial Japanese Army officer corps that promoted a militaristic totalitarian national socialist system as an alternative to the current corrupt party policies, inspired other groups in the armed forces to make similar plans. Two major ideological factions emerged in the army: Tōseiha and Kōdōha, which began to feud with each other.\n\nIn 1934, a group of five cadets from the Imperial Japanese Army Military Academy, led by two army officers belonging to the Kōdōha faction, worried about the impending loss of their faction's influence on the armed forces after the dismissal of Army Minister Sadao Araki in January 1934, formed their own plan to overthrow the government. However, in early November 1934, the secret services managed to prevent this conspiracy due to the fact that information about it was disclosed by one of its participants.\n\nIn March 1934, one of the leaders of the Tōseiha, Nagata Tetsuzan, was appointed head of the military Affairs service of the Ministry of the Japanese Army, after which the persecution of the Kōdōha intensified and their gradual ousting from senior command posts in the army. Because of this, Colonel Saburō Aizawa, a young member of the Kōdōha, killed Nagata as "responsible for the repression in the army."\n\nAt the moment, the murder trial has begun in Tokyo, but his defenders, also members of the Kōdōha, decided to use him as a platform to promote their ideas."

 NW_JAP.55.t: "In the Middle of a Trial"
 NW_JAP.55.d: "The young officers continue to emphasize Saburō's moral principles, who acted in the interests of the nation and the Emperor. Their defense is based on the fact that the assassinated general was guilty of purges and splitting the army into separate factions, which undermined its combat effectiveness. At the same time, they continued to spread propaganda of their own ideology of "Shōwa restoration" in the courtroom in front of a large media crowd. The trial itself ended with a rather predictable decision - the death penalty for Saburō Aizawa."

And they were unexpectedly won by the opposition Rikken Minseitō party, which before these elections changed its rhetoric to more militaristic in order to gain popularity among the voters. Not least in Minseitō victory was the split in the Seiyūkai after the vote of no confidence: about 20 people left the party and formed the independent Shōwakai group, which continued to support the Okada government."

 NW_JAP.57.d: "It is known that all the rebels are personnel of the 1st Infantry Guards Division, which was stationed in the capital, but was supposed to be relocated to Manchuria in the coming weeks. The leaders of the mutiny appear to be a group of junior officers (ranging in rank from lieutenant to captain) led by Captain Ando, who constantly interact with their soldiers, and counting on their full loyalty, led them out of the barracks to commit their daring act. Soldiers of the 1st Guards Infantry Division of the Imperial Japanese Army occupied the territory of the Imperial Palace and began to allow only a limited number of people.\n\nThrough their envoys among the senior officers, they handed over their "Manifesto of the Uprising" to the emperor, in which they put forward their political demands: the dismissal of some of the top officers, as well as the appointment of a new government headed by General Jinzaburō Masaki. Masaki is the leader of the Kōdōha in the army and was removed from his post as head of the army General Staff in the middle of last year by imperial decree.\n\nIn the morning, the emperor was visited by Masaki himself, the emperor's uncle, Prince Fushimi, who is the chief of the General Staff of the Fleet, and Admiral Eisuke Yamamoto, the leader of the Fleet Faction that has achieved withdrawal from the arms limitation agreement with the United States and Great Britain. They conveyed the demands of the rebels to the emperor. They were also supported by the emperor's aide–de–camp, General and now Baron Shigeru Honjō, the organizer of the capture of Manchuria, and Imperial Prince Asaka, the commander of the 1st Imperial Guards Division. All of them are asking for Masaki's imperial decree on the formation of the Cabinet of Ministers in order to calm the situation and prevent unnecessary bloodshed."

 NW_JAP.57.b: "The rebels should immediately disperse to their barracks and stop this monstrous performance"
 NW_JAP.58.t: "The Results of the Guard's Performance"
 NW_JAP.58.d: "The soldiers of the revolted division dispersed to their barracks, but the bloody snow had to be shoveled through the streets of Tokyo for several more hours. It turned out that in parallel with the seizure of the Imperial Palace, detachments of the Guards raided not only various government offices, but first of all, the residences of many politicians, officials and military men who were interfering, in their opinion, with "the rule of the Emperor and the restoration of the greatness of Japan". After a time, it can be stated that there was a de facto coup d'état in the country."
 NW_JAP.58.a: "How dare they..."
 NW_JAP.59.t: "Hirohito's Abdication"
 NW_JAP.59.d: "Without any communication with the outside world, having found himself blocked in his own palace by rebellious Guard units, the emperor had to sign an abdication for himself and his young son. Thus, the throne passed to Hirohito's younger brother Yasuhito, Prince Chichibu, who had been on friendly terms with the army leaders of the Kodoha faction since the early 1930s.\n\n\nIn a long time, until Hirohito could not find his offspring, Yasuhito was considered the heir to the throne, but in 1933 he passed the post to Akihito, the emperor's son. In addition, Prince Chichibu, even after the first attempted military coups in the early 30s, demanded that his older brother introduce direct imperial rule in order to restore order in the country and implement the necessary reforms, so it is unclear how he will develop relations with General Masaki and the coup officers who put him on the throne."

 NW_JAP_news.2.d: "The events that began in the Japanese capital on the night of February 26 may have reached their denouement, or perhaps only approached their climax - de facto the rebels' demands were met and General Jinzaburō Masaki, a leader of one of the army factions who had good relations with the conspirators, was appointed prime minister. However, he is said to have a nasty relationship with the emperor as well as many other members of the political elite. Because of this, it is assumed that the current cabinet will be a temporary one on the way to stabilizing Tokyo. The conspirators have dispersed to their barracks and "they were sort of pardoned," despite the assassination of several politicians of the previous cabinet."

 NW_JAP.60.d: "It is known that all the rebels are personnel of the 1st Infantry Guards Division, which was stationed in the capital, but was supposed to be relocated to Manchuria in the coming weeks. The leaders of the mutiny appear to be a group of junior officers (ranging in rank from lieutenant to captain) led by Captain Ando, who constantly interact with their soldiers, and counting on their full loyalty, led them out of the barracks to commit their daring act.\n\nThey have not yet decided to enter the palace, but through their envoys among the senior officers they handed over their "Manifesto of the Uprising" to the emperor, in which they put forward their political demands: the dismissal of some of the top officers, as well as the appointment of a new government headed by General Jinzaburō Masaki.

They took a tough stance, advising the emperor to demand that efforts be focused on suppressing the uprising and not accept the resignation of the current government, as this "would actually mean the victory of the rebel army."
 NW_JAP.60.a: "This rebellion must be quelled immediately"
 NW_JAP.61.t: "The Military's Procrastination"
 NW_JAP.61.d: "Senior army leaders appear to be uninvolved in the events, as they too are in a state of confusion. In addition, the intra-army confrontation between the two factions (Kōdōha and Tōseiha) is still going on, as both are trying to use the uprising for their own personal goals in order to take down the opposing faction. However, it should be noted that both factions are afraid to call what is happening a "rebellion" or "mutiny" in order not to spoil the reputation of the army and its best units, the Guards, since it was the Guards infantry unit that committed this daring act. Against this background, the Navy's actions look much more dignified. Admiral Yonai, commander-in-chief of the Tokyo Maritime District, has already issued a statement in which he called the rebels "rebel troops," brought about 40 ships into the capital's harbor, took the Maritime Command building under guard, and said that the sailors are ready to defend the Imperial Palace if necessary. \At this time, two groups of forces have formed within the army, offering their own vision of further events: on the one hand, the Supreme Military Council, an unofficial body uniting the leaders of all army leaders, dominated by supporters of the Kōdōha faction. They favor a peaceful resolution to the incident, offering their services as negotiators, including General Masaki, with whom the rebels have confirmed their willingness to negotiate. On the other side is the General Headquarters, where Tōseiha forces are concentrated, who favor decisive action and refusal to negotiate with the rebels."

 NW_JAP.62.d: "General Masaki managed to negotiate with the leaders of the rebels, and they are ready to disperse their units to their barracks if they see the Emperor's official decree to return to their places. However, it should be noted that before this, the members of the Supreme Military Council arbitrarily handed over to the rebels a statement of de facto recognition of their demands, which can be characterized as the Supreme Military Council's solidarity with the rebels.\n\nAt the same time, General Hajime Sugiyama, the head of the General Staff and a staunch supporter of Tōseiha, once again declared that the rebels must be crushed if they are not willing to lay down their arms."
 NW_JAP.62.a: "An imperial decree is out of the question, they have to do it without one"
 NW_JAP.62.b: "All right, the decree will be"
 NW_JAP.63.t: "Time Dragging"
 NW_JAP.63.d: "The Chief of General Staff, General Hajime Sugiyama, despite his steadfast vision of a radical suppression of the coup, made an initial mistake in calling for reinforcements - not knowing the exact number of rebels, he moved too few forces to the capital in case of resistance from the rebels, so the resolution of the incident is again delayed. \n\nMeanwhile, the Emperor himself is becoming increasingly impatient with the army's failure to suppress the rebellion as he had ordered the day before. The fleet's quick response satisfied him, but the army's hesitation was inexplicable to the emperor. When some members of his entourage spoke in defense of the officers' motives, Hirohito angrily replied that "killing my ministers is tantamount to strangling me," and added that the rebels deserved no leniency. At one point Hirohito became so impatient that he threatened to take personal command of the Imperial Guard and order them to attack the rebels themselves."

 NW_JAP.64.d: "After the soldiers and officers were informed that the emperor was asking them to return to their barracks to maintain peace and prosperity, they complied.

These included units stationed near Tokyo, soldiers of the Imperial Guard, and Admiral Yonai's marines. The rebels had little chance; about half of them surrendered as soon as the first shots were heard from the government troops, but the rest resisted. All of the rebel leaders died along with their soldiers, whom they condemned to death by their thoughtless actions. However, we still don't know who else was involved in this coup: we can investigate in which one of the army factions will finally try to destroy its rival."

Airplanes flew over the rebels scattered propaganda sheets with these words, and negotiators were sent to them. Most of the rebel officers committed seppuku and the rest surrendered.

He sent loyal naval units to guard the imperial palace, and then distributed his proclamation to the rebels, in which he informed them that the emperor did not support their demands and waited for them to disperse to their barracks. In case of failure to comply with these decrees, the admiral would have to resolve the incident by force using his available shipboard artillery. The bulk of the rebel officers committed seppuku and the rest surrendered. The soldiers dispersed to their barracks and were promised forgiveness if they did so."

They were the last genro Saionji Kinmochi, Prime Minister Keisuke Okada, politicians Makino Nobuaki, Saitō Makoto, Takahashi Korekiyo and Kantarō Suzuki, and military leader Jyōtarō Watanabe. In the end, Watanabe, Makoto, Korekiyo and, as was believed throughout the incident, Prime Minister Okada were all killed. It turned out that he was saved by his own son-in-law - Colonel Denzo Matsuo, who pretended to be the prime minister, while Okada himself hid in the attic of his residence. The rebels, having killed Matsuo, thought their task was accomplished and did not search the entire building. When the incident was over, the prime minister managed to escape from his hiding place. The emperor now asks Okada to return to his duties, but the admiral feels that he has disgraced himself by allowing the coup to take place, so he feels it necessary to resign and be replaced by someone else."

 NW_JAP.70.t: "New Prime Minister"
 NW_JAP.70.d: "After already former Prime Minister Keisuke Okada failed to reclaim the post, the emperor will have to choose a new head of government. The last genro who miraculously survived the incident, Saionji Kimmochi, had originally proposed Fumimaro Konoe, but he declined the position due to illness. The emperor was then offered Hirota Kōki, the foreign minister from the previous government, instead. He was a man from a simple family, not belonging to any party or faction, but excelled in his diplomatic duties. Hirohito asked Saionji whether a man of such low prestige should be appointed to the post, but the elderly and liberal-minded genro said it did not matter."
 NW_JAP.70.a: "We'll trust that advice"

 NW_JAP.71.d: "After Emperor Hirohito had a private conversation with Keisuke Okada, in which he spoke about the excellent actions of the fleet during the incident, as well as expressed his personal confidence in the prime minister and asked for help in such a difficult time for the country, the admiral had no choice but to agree to postpone the decision to resign from his post."

However, it is necessary to decide whether this military tribunal will be held in the same way as the previous ones (for example, the January Sabourō Aizawa tribunal), or whether to organize a secret trial in which the defendants will not have the right to legal representation, to call witnesses or to appeal.\n\n\n\nIn the first case, it will certainly be an additional blow to the prestige of the army, but on the other hand, it may allow to return it to the control of the civilian government. However, it could also lead to destabilization of the situation in the country."

During it, the rebel officers accused of mutiny claimed that their actions had been approved by a proclamation issued by the War Minister after the rebellion began, but they also confirmed that they had never formally presented themselves to the imperial command. In the end, most of them were found guilty and five were sentenced to death."
 NW_JAP.73.a: "A sad end"
 NW_JAP.74.d: "The trial was held in secret. The judges did not listen to the motives and intentions of the defendants - they only forced them to focus on their actions during their testimony. Thus, the trial was very different from a regular court-martial. The rebel officers charged with mutiny claimed that their actions had been approved by a proclamation issued by the Minister of War after the rebellion began, but they also confirmed that they had never formally presented themselves to the imperial command. In the end, all were found guilty, of whom seventeen were sentenced to death."

Since the introduction of the constitution in 1891, emperors have interfered less and less in political life, and the previous Emperor Hirohito was a supporter of British-style monarchy, where the emperor plays a symbolic role and is merely a sovereign uniting the nation. The current emperor, however, being a military man and having become acquainted in this environment with radical reformers among the junior officers, now wants to put these ideas into practice, leading the country out of the political crisis that has engulfed it since the Great Depression."
 NW_JAP_news.5.a: "Yasuhito is very different from his brother"
 NW_JAP.82.t: "Elections After the State of Emergency"
 NW_JAP.82.d: "After a period in which the work of parliament was paralyzed and the emperor acted according to his own vision of the political situation, it was time to return to constitutional rule. This was the will of the emperor, so it was necessary to hold a new parliamentary election. They were won by the Constitutional Democratic Party (Rikken Minseitō) led by its leader Machuda Chūji..."
 NW_JAP.82.a: "...who becomes the new prime minister of the country!"
 NW_JAP.83.t: "Ōkawa is Completely Free"
 NW_JAP.83.d: "Ōkawa Shūmei has long led a double life: on the one hand, a quiet academic, philosopher and journalist, speaking out on hot political topics. Knowing several languages and visiting many countries, he gained fame in wide circles, including through the printing of his journals with articles.\n\n\nOn the other hand, in parallel with this was a secret life Ōkawa - as a member and organizer of secret political societies. And if during the 20-ies all these societies were engaged in theoretical developments and almost did not go "into the political environment", rather gathering their supporters, in the early 30-ies Ōkawa "went on the attack". His participation in the Manchurian Incident, which ended with the creation of Manchukuo, is hard to underestimate, given the more than a hundred lectures he gave around the country on the importance of capturing this piece of China. In parallel, preparations were underway for coups d'état in Tokyo, several attempts at which failed, eventually leading to Ōkawa's arrest and imprisonment. One of these attempts was supposed to have involved General Araki, the founder of the Kodoha faction. However, he served only about a year instead of the 7 years he was supposed to serve, and was released through collusion with the authorities. But now that General Masaki has come to power and lost control over a group of young officers who continue to demand radical reforms, the conservative generals in Kōdōha have no choice but to recall their old ties with Ōkawa and offer him a new deal: to enter the Kōdōha military."

 NW_JAP_news.6.d: "It seemed that it was difficult to surprise the common man with any more surprising news from Japan after the military coup at the end of February, but today it will surely succeed - the Emperor appointed the radical Ikki Kita as the new Prime Minister. This legendary man in the narrow political circle of the Japanese Empire was almost persona non grata, so radical were his proposals for restructuring the state system. Ikki is a socialist and an ultra-monarchist at the same time. However, the new Emperor Yasuhito is said to have been introduced to Kita in the early 1930s by his friends from the group of young officers who staged the recent coup d'état."

 NW_JAP.85.t: "Emergency Address to the Nation"
 NW_JAP.85.d: "Prince Naruhiko, who took power in the country, addressed the nation with his statement. He tried to make it in the clearest possible form and called himself 'the guarantor of the imperial house.' He said that all the events that had taken place in the country after February 26 were the fruit of the Imperial Army conspirators who had long been trying to destabilize the country against the Emperor's opinion and wanted to "return the political system to the days of the Shogunate" in order to rule indiscriminately, deceiving ordinary people with beautiful promises. Now the prince has taken matters into his own hands and declared a period of state of emergency, necessary to restore order in the country and establish economic and political life."
 NW_JAP.85.a: "But after all, the conspirators of February 26 also claimed that they were acting on behalf of the Emperor...."
 NW_JAP_news.20.t: "[GetNewsHeadline] A Counter Coup in Tokyo"
 NW_JAP_news.20.d: "Emperor Hirohito's uncle, Prince Naruhiko, was the man who was finally able to take matters into his own hands, remove the conspirators who had come to power in a military mutiny in late February, and restore legitimate authority to the country. He made an address to the nation through journalists and radio, where he called himself "the guarantor of the imperial house" and declared that all the events that had occurred in the country were the fruit of a conspiracy of people who wanted to restore the system of the Shogunate period, to prevent the emperor from caring for the nation and leading it to prosperity. He explicitly called them conspirators and people who had committed treason against the emperor. He also declared a national state of emergency to restore order and capture all those involved in this heinous crime."

In addition, it will be necessary to invite Manchukuo-Go politicians, as it will also participate in future agreements."

 NW_JAP.88.t: "A Categorical Refusal by the Chinese Side"
 NW_JAP.88.d: "In spite of the mutually beneficial proposals for cooperation that we offered, the Chinese representatives flatly refused to discuss such agreements. Probably the main obstacle for them was the clause on the recognition of Manchukuo-Go."

 NW_JAP.89.d: "The Japanese government wishes to acquire an iron ore mine on the territory of our country through a state-owned company. The Japanese Empire has always been short of minerals, but as we know steel is one of the most important resources for warfare. Therefore, by preventing the Japanese from making the intended purchase, we can temper their ardor."

 NW_JAP.92.d: "It is time for China and Japan to resolve the Mongolian issue and the fate of several state entities in Inner Mongolia. At the moment there are two parallel governments there - pro-China and pro-Japanese.

 NW_JAP.92.a: "Let's hope the Mongols abide by this decision"
 NW_JAP.93.t: "Restoring Relations with Japan"
 NW_JAP.93.d: "Since the Republic of China has recently concluded an agreement with the Empire of Japan, establishing allied relations with it, reaffirming the joint struggle against communism in Asia, and thus recognizing the independence of Manchukuo-Go, it becomes necessary for the other world powers to take this step as well, despite attempts to isolate Japan diplomatically after the seizure of Manchuria."

After that, they held a press conference with journalists from the world's leading publications. At the end of the meeting, the leaders arrived at the coast of the city, where they held a ceremonial laying of the new Statue of Liberty - in honor of friendship between the Japanese and American peoples.

 NW_JAP.100.d: "Relations between the United States and the Empire of Japan have been strained since 1931, when the Japanese military invaded China and proclaimed Manchukuo-Go with the deposed Emperor Pu Yi at its head. However, the volume of mutual trade between the countries remained high as before. First of all, this was due to Japan's material dependence on foreign countries.\n\n\nThe next, in 1937, Japan launched a full-scale invasion of China. Several attempts at peace talks then failed, and a few years later the war reached a stalemate - the Japanese could not effectively subdue the invaded territories, the Chinese could not regain their land. At the same time, both sides continued to stand on their negotiating positions. The current, new Japanese government has set its goal to achieve a resolution of the "Chinese incident," as they call it, with the support of our country. This is necessary to restore good-neighborly relations between us, restore trade and end the endless hostilities."

Also today, journalits reported that Japanese troops had dramatically increased their numbers into Indochina and occupied the southern part of Indochina. The Japanese government has not commented on this situation in any way, but reports from the field indicate that it was the unauthorised prank of another Japanese general, which was swallowed by the Japanese government.

But at the same time he is a staunch opponent of war with Western powers, his "political mentor" was the last elder statesman of Japan, Genrō Kimmochi Saionji, an absolutely pro-Western liberal politician who once represented his country at the Paris Peace Conference after the Great War. Konoe's son, however, had himself studied in the United States in the early 1930s and when his father visited he had a private, unofficial meeting with President Roosevelt."
 NW_JAP.127.a: "We agree to a meeting, but before the meeting we need to agree on the outcome of the meeting."
 NW_JAP.127.b: "We're willing to meet, but we'd rather do it in Alaska, in the town of Juneau."
 NW_JAP.127.c: "We do not see the meeting as a possible scenario for negotiations."
 NW_JAP.128.t: "prerequisites"
 NW_JAP.128.d: "The American president is ready to go to a personal meeting with Prime Minister Konoe, but to organise it, it is necessary to initially show that Japan is not pursuing an aggressive invasive policy, which is the American demand. Otherwise, a meeting between the leaders would be misunderstood by the public and other countries. Such a gesture could be the withdrawal of troops from Indochina. However, again, to do such a thing, we need to influence the army top brass."
 NW_JAP.128.a: "We have this opportunity!"
 NW_JAP.128.b: "That seems like an impossible task. I'd rather resign. I guess so."
 NW_JAP.130.t: "The Consent of the Americans"
 NW_JAP.130.d: "The American government has agreed to our ambitious proposal. The meeting will still be held in Alaska, in Juneau, and not, as originally planned, in Hawaii. Konoe must do all this secretly enough that the people who want to eliminate him will not be able to do anything about it. From a conspiracy point of view, Alaska is even better than Hawaii."
 NW_JAP.130.a: "Prince Konoe, please hurry up and get in the car to the airport!!"
 NW_JAP.131.t: "The Americans Are Offering Mediation"
 NW_JAP.131.d: "We have been notified by the American Government that they will shortly hold talks with Japanese representatives concerning the withdrawal of their armies from the invaded countries of Asia. They are inquiring as to our position on the old draft armistice, involving American recognition of Manchukuo-Go, international recognition of our Government, and the withdrawal of Japanese troops from China."

However, it became possible after the Japanese and American leaders needed a place where they could meet face-to-face. Preparations for this meeting had already been underway for weeks - almost in secret, as it had opponents in both countries. But this meeting was needed as air to avoid the war that was already on the horizon after the United States imposed a trade embargo on Japan. Japanese Prime Minister Fumimaro Konoe, a staunch opponent of war with the U.S., was able to negotiate in a private meeting with the American president a U.S.-brokered peace between China and Japan, as had once happened in 1905 after the Russo-Japanese War, on the following terms: the US lifts any restrictions on trade with Japan, the US recognises Manchukuo as an independent state, Japan recognises the current Chinese government with the condition that it includes politicians from the pro-Japanese governments in the occupied territories, Japan withdraws all its troops from China. After the conclusion of the conference, journalists were invited to the announcement of the terms of peace, as well as to the solemn part - the mutual handshake of the two leaders, which was an important symbol of the meeting.

 NW_JAP.132.d: "The news of the Alaska conference hit Japan like a thunderclap. Some people began to rejoice with enthusiasm at the conclusion of the Chinese incident and the fact that war with the United States had been avoided and that Japanese financial assets had been unfrozen. Others, predominantly military officers and people with a military stream, began to demonstrate in the streets of Tokyo. The officers themselves do not believe that the entire army, which had been involved in battles with the Chinese, could be quietly withdrawn to Japanese soil. Prince Konoe returned to Haneda Airport, which had been cordoned off beforehand to prevent unnecessary unrest. However, threats are already being made towards the prime minister by the most radical members of the army and politics. After a meeting of the former prime ministers, it was decided that the emperor should make an address to the nation confirming the withdrawal of troops from China."

 NW_JAP.133.d: "The saddest expectations were confirmed - Prince Konoe was assassinated during his visit to the government buildings in the capital. The identity of the assassin was surprising - it was General Masanobu Tsuji, who attempted to commit the crime with his katana. Konoe's personal driver rushed at Masanobu, who was approaching the prime minister, but was not in time - the distance was too close, and the general acted with lightning speed. Despite the attempt to get the prince to the hospital quickly, he lost consciousness extremely quickly - the katana pierced his stomach through, and the loss of blood was monstrous."

 NW_JAP.134.d: "The saddest expectations were confirmed - Prince Konoe was assassinated during his visit to the government buildings in the capital. The identity of the assassin was surprising - it was General Masanobu Tsuji, who attempted to commit the crime with his katana. The prince was saved by his driver, who rushed at the general from behind and knocked him to the ground. That Tsuji was able to get so fatally close to the Prime Minister's figure means that he had sympathetic participants in the crime."

 NW_JAP_news.12.d: "The positive headlines of international newspapers reporting how the Japanese prime minister and the American president had managed to reach an understanding at the Alaska conference were instantly replaced by the terrible news of the Prime Minister's assassination. The Japanese "doves of peace" had long claimed that the supporters of war in their country had many forces, and more importantly, radical supporters ready to commit such a heinous act. One of them was General Masanobu Tsuji - with each new act of terrorism, done by the military in Japan, the ranks of the killers grew and grew, and reached such high ranks. The man who saved Asia from a major war could not find a response in his homeland. The President of the United States [USA.GetLeader] has already called it a "crime against peace and Asia" and expressed his condolences to the Japanese people and the Konoe family. Some suggested that this would turn the whole situation around, but no - the emperor himself addressed the nation and supported the Prime Minister's course on the eve of the assassination and what's more the killer-general has already been arrested and is being prepared for trial."

After firing all the bullets, he fled in an unknown direction and has not been found yet. Good luck no one was injured except for the car.

 NW_JAP.138.d: "American President Roosevelt offered, in exchange for the withdrawal of Japanese troops from Indochina, a treaty between Japan on the one hand and Great Britain, the Netherlands, and the United States on the other. Under the proposed treaty, Japan would be guaranteed a substantial supply of natural resources. Roosevelt believed that French Indochina could be turned into "Asian Switzerland". Perhaps this is our real chance to right the wrongs and prevent the criminal  war between the countries."

However, the leaders of these countries managed to "cool the hotheads" and found a peaceful solution to the conflict. Today between representatives of the Empire of Japan, the United States of America and France an agreement was concluded on the complete withdrawal of Japanese troops from Indochina in exchange for the restoration of trade relations with Japan, as well as the establishment of an "open door" condition in Indochina itself and declaring it a neutral territory.

Despite your position to avoid negotiations in every possible way, we propose to resume the conference". The Manchurian conference between  the representatives of Mongolia and Manchukuo was held in 1935 to establish the border between these states, as the positions of the Soviet and Japanese sides do not coincide on this issue - the maps were too inaccurate. Because of this, over the past few years there have been constant armed clashes on the border between the two countries. In addition, since the MPR and the Manchurian state are both in approximately the same international status, the Japanese representatives insist on discussing the issue of mutual recognition of the two states.

The Japanese Prime Minister referred to the military action in East Asia and the Pacific as the 'Great East Asian War'.

The excessive strengthening of the executive's power, even in times of war, could allow some dormant political forces to take advantage of the situation and launch a 'creeping coup d'état'.

The most unexpected result of the revolt was that the supposedly assassinated former Prime Minister Keisuke Okada almost turned up at his own funeral, when it turned out that the rebels had killed the wrong man, mistaking him for his own father-in-law, who actually looked like him. He spent those days hiding in the attic of his own house, where he was never found. However, when he appeared before the Emperor, he resigned, feeling that he was responsible for the mutiny and that he had deceived the Emperor by faking his death. His resignation was accepted and Kōki Hirota, a career diplomat who had served as foreign minister in the previous government, was chosen as the new prime minister and began to promote the idea of rapprochement between China and Japan."

Сложилось мнение, что именно за продвижение этой политики Такахаси был убит во время путча 26 февраля. Из-за этого новые министры финансов не желают повторять судьбу своего предшественника и предлагают увеличенный бюджет, чтобы удовлетворить желания военных, даже несмотря на угрозу нового витка инфляции.

 NW_JAP.177.d: "С каждым годом обсуждение бюджета в парламенте становится всё более тяжёлым испытанием для всего кабинета министров, так как рост цен в стране уже набирает обороты по всей стране и это вызывает общественное недовольство, выражающееся в том числе через парламент. В то же время военные хотят расширение армейского бюджета, поэтому правительство находится в тяжёлом положении."

 NW_JAP.178.t: "The Economic Crisis"
 NW_JAP.178.d.a: "Due to the inability of the current government of the country to stop rising inflation, his popularity began to fall sharply. Many cabinet members began to talk about their possible exit from the cabinet, even the military were unhappy with such failures. In this difficult situation, Prime Minister [JAP.GetLeader] decided that he had no choice but to resign."
 NW_JAP.178.d.b: "$NW_JAP.178.d.a$\n\nThe most obvious recommendation of the new head of the Cabinet of Ministers is Yoshida Shigeru from the Ministry of the Interior, one of the leaders of reformist bureaucrats who have been trying for several years to implement their economic reforms in Manchukuo. Their ideas can help to cope with the economic crisis that has engulfed the country."
 NW_JAP.178.d.c: "$NW_JAP.178.d.a$\n\nIn this regard, it became necessary to choose a person for the role of the new head of the Cabinet of Ministers. Quickly enough, among the names listed, the candidacy of Prince Fumimaro Konoe surfaced, who had already once been offered to head the government immediately after the incident on February 26, but then he declined the position. In the current difficult situation, only he will be able to lead the reforms necessary for the country."

 NW_JAP.179.t: "Military Proposals on Political Reforms"
 NW_JAP.179.d: "The Army and Navy ministers have also proposed a number of radical administrative reforms. Their plans include the creation of a body under the Prime Minister to handle budgetary research and policy, a personnel agency reporting only to the Prime Minister to centralise authority over civil service appointments, the merging of several government ministries, the transfer of posts from one ministry to another, and the expansion of agencies to regulate trade, fuel, electricity and civil aircraft. Their plan also calls for radical reforms of local government, in parallel with the centralisation of the national administration. In short, the plan is an attempt by the military to reorganise Japan's economic, political and administrative structure into a 'national defence state'."
 NW_JAP.179.a: "Such radical changes are certain to break the balance of power in our nation"
 NW_JAP.180.t: "Suppression Speech"
 NW_JAP.180.d: "- A constitutional politician must stand before and among the people and engage in fair political debate for the development of the nation. It is inexcusable for a constitutional politician to plot behind the scenes. It is shameful and corrupt for politicians to collude with the military outside the political sphere to achieve their own ambitions.\n\nToday's parliamentary session could go down in history, according to the newspapers. Saitō Takao, a prominent critic of militarism and fascism, a liberal and member of the Rikken Minseitō party, gave an hour and a half speech from the Parliament rostrum, beginning with an address to War Minister Hisaichi Terauchi, in which he called on the military to engage in army reform and also asked the cabinet to comment on the national reforms proposed by the War Ministry.\n\nIn the second half of his speech, he addressed the February 26 incident, criticising the young soldiers' action and the military's interference in politics, and suggesting that the senior military's relaxed reaction to the May 15 incident may have been a major cause of the attempted mutiny.\n\nAll the major newspapers in Tokyo ran a front-page headline in capital letters about Saitō Takao's speech, praising it as an unprecedented and historic parliamentary speech. At the end of the parliamentary session, Saitō was surrounded by journalists outside the Parliament building and asked to comment.\n\n- I think that even if I die, this speech will remain for a long time in the constitutional history of our country."

 NW_JAP.182.t: "The Harakiri Debate"
 NW_JAP.182.d: "The annual budget discussion for the upcoming fiscal year was supposed to take place today in the Lower House of Parliament, but it was unexpectedly interrupted by a debate between Minister of War Hisaichi Terauchi and Kunimatsu Hamada, the oldest member of parliament from the Rikken Seiyūkai.\n\n- In recent years, due to special circumstances, freedom of speech has been under pressure, and people cannot say what they want to say, and they are dissatisfied. Besides, at the same time, the military is proud of itself... the political ideology of strengthening the dictatorship always comes from the army. \n\nIn general, he criticized the military's interference in the civilian government, recalling recent incidents, especially the attempted coup in early 1936. After that, the Minister of the Army Terauchi took the floor: \n\n- These last words make me feel that I and the military personnel are despised here.\n\nHamada clarified: \n\n- Please provide the facts about what offended the army in my words. \n\n- It sounded like an insult. - Terauchi paraphrased. \n\nHamada came out again and said that if Terauchi proved insulting the army in his words, he would commit harakiri, but if not, then Terauchi would have to commit it. This was the last straw for the military, who is now demanding that the Prime Minister dissolve parliament in order to "teach a lesson to political parties that lack knowledge about the entire situation in the country.""
 NW_JAP.182.a: "We will not do this on Terauchi's orders."
 
 NW_JAP.183.t: "Terauchi Resigns"
 NW_JAP.183.d.a: "Army Minister Hisaichi Terauchi resigned after the prime minister refused to dissolve the lower house of parliament or resign himself. Now we need to decide what to do in this situation. Since we have restored the rule on current army ministers, we will probably have to search for a replacement for the post of Minister of War for a long time and confrontationally, interacting with the retired Terauchi, who clearly despises the current government and will do everything in his power to thwart the prime minister."
 NW_JAP.183.d.b: "Army Minister Hisaichi Terauchi resigned after the prime minister refused to dissolve the lower house of parliament or resign himself. Now we need to decide what to do in this situation. We can choose a new Minister of the Army, or resign. Two options are proposed as new candidates for the post of minister: either the leader of the Manchurian faction, Seishirō Itagaki, who was already considered for this post, or a more neutral figure, General Hajime Sugiyama, who, however, was previously associated with General Ugaki and his faction."
 NW_JAP.183.a: "Let's choose Itagaki as the new Minister of the Army."
 NW_JAP.183.b: "Let's choose Sugiyama as the new Minister of the Army."
 NW_JAP.183.c: "So the prime minister will also have to leave his post."
 
 NW_JAP.184.t: "Recommendation from Konoe"
 NW_JAP.184.d: "Since Prime Minister Kōki Hirota had to resign in order to deal with the conflict situation in parliament, the emperor now needs to choose a new prime minister again. These recommendations will now be handled by Lord Keeper of the Privy Seal Fumimaro Konoe, the political heir to the retired last genrō Kimmochi Saionji, who previously dealt with this issue. Since Hirota had to resign due to a conflict with the army, Prince Konoe wants to implement his old idea to appease the ambitions of the military - to give them the opportunity to form a government, hoping that they are inexperienced in this matter and will fail on this path after some time, as a result of which they will be discredited. in society. Accordingly, he proposes General Senjuro Hayashi, the former Minister of the Army from Okada's cabinet, who resigned in the fall of 1935, as the next prime minister. At the moment, he is considered the patron saint of the Manchurian faction and the Tōseiha in the army."
 NW_JAP.184.a: "It's an adventurous plan, but since Konoe thinks so, then we agree."
 
 NW_JAP.185.t: "Recommendation from Genrō"
 NW_JAP.185.d: "Since Prime Minister Kōki Hirota had to resign in order to deal with the conflict situation in parliament, the emperor now needs to choose a new prime minister again. Genrō Saionji Kimmochi proposed General Ugaki Kazushige, who is currently the governor of Korea, to the Emperor. This is a very controversial recommendation because of the reputation that has developed around General Ugaki. On the one hand, he participated in the March 1931 military coup, and only at the last moment refused to support the conspirators. On the other hand, he was engaged in the modernization of the army by reducing its size, which earned him the hatred of some officers who had no place in the new army. In addition to all this, Ugaki has become close to party politicians in recent years, and especially the Rikken Minseitō party. Saionji believes that only a major army figure like Ugaki can subdue her."
 NW_JAP.185.a: "Is this really a good choice..."
 
 NW_JAP.186.t: "Recommendation from Genrō"
 NW_JAP.186.d: "Since Prime Minister Kōki Hirota had to resign in order to deal with the conflict situation in parliament, the emperor now needs to choose a new prime minister again. Genro Saionji Kimmochi, after much thought, suggested that the emperor give the imperial decree on the formation of the government to Prince Fumimaro Konoe, despite his refusal to lead the country the previous time. Saionji found this decision difficult, as he understands the enormous responsibility that will fall on the shoulders of his political "heir," to whom he would have wished for better times to occupy such a responsible position. However, now only such a popular figure in society as Konoe will be able to cope with difficult external and internal conditions."
 NW_JAP.186.a: "Now the prince has nowhere to retreat to. He can't say no twice."

 NW_JAP_news.19.t: "[GetNewsHeadline] General Ugaki Became Japan's Prime Minister"
 NW_JAP_news.19.d: "General Kejisuke Ugaki became the new Prime Minister of the Empire of Japan. He is a well-known figure in Japanese politics, having been the Minister of War in the late 1920s, when he attempted to modernise the army by cutting its budget, much to the discontent of many officers. However, he managed to build up a sufficient faction of supporters. A series of unfortunate scandals in the early 1930s, including an attempt to take part in a failed coup d'état, cost him his position and influence. At the same time, he was a staunch supporter of peace with the Western powers and the preservation of the previous political regime. It is worth noting that, according to journalists, the formation of the general's cabinet was not without difficulties and resistance from the army elite."

Ugaki's response was not long in coming - Ishiwara's 'promotion' and return to direct command of the army was said to have severed his ties with Tokyo politics once again.\n\nHowever, it may only anger the irrepressible officer and lead to a new increase in political instability due to military..."

In the end, he came up with nothing better than to propose at an official meeting of the Diet the creation of a new party that would include supporters of a one-party state. After this proposal, the Diet exploded with a thousand arguments and discussions. Hirota managed to bring the supporters and opponents of the idea together, thus avoiding unnecessary problems. The Diet was roughly evenly divided, although one might have expected the idea to be universally rejected in the Diet. However, almost all the smaller parties, as well as Tōhōkai and part of Shakai Taishūtō, supported the idea. Many members of the Rikken Seiyūkai were also in favour.\n\nNow the Prime Minister has to decide what to do next. The attempt to ‘test the reaction’ to the one-party state has gone too far and requires him not to retract his words. However, he may offer someone else to lead this new party, as he still left himself ‘room for manoeuvre’ in this matter when he made his speech in the Parliament."

Many are now waiting for this new party to be formed, and the person who does so must have the appropriate skills.\n\nThe informal leader of the reformist bureaucrats, $JAP_Fumio_Goto$, is a suitable person for this role, as the faction has its own plan for change, which may fit well with the idea of a one-party state. On the other hand, there is the irrepressible leader of the Manchurian faction, Kanji Ishiwara, whose popularity with the people will allow him to fulfil the role of leader of the only party in the country."

In the end, he came up with nothing better than to propose at an official meeting of the Diet the creation of a new party that would include supporters of a one-party state. He also said that he could lead such a party himself.\n\nAfter this proposal, the Diet exploded with a thousand arguments and discussions. Hirota managed to bring the supporters and opponents of the idea together, thus avoiding unnecessary problems. Moreover, in this dispute, the supporters of the one-party system gave way to its opponents - in parliament, logically, support for the idea was low: mainly representatives of small parties, radicals, fascists and a faction within Shakai Taishūtō supported a one-party regime.\n\nIt is also possible that the idea was defeated by the fact that it was put forward in parliament by the current prime minister, Hirota, who does not have the best reputation or standing among the elites. Now that the idea of a one-party state has been partially discredited, the head of government has to find 'ways out' - either to resign or to keep his post by relying on someone else."

 NW_JAP.194.t: "High-Level Conversation"
 NW_JAP.194.d: "Kōki Hirota's original plan was to gradually return to party cabinets by stabilising the political environment. Facing major challenges along the way, such as the One Party Movement, was a daunting task, but one that he managed, perhaps without realising it. He destroyed its reputation in Parliament at the expense of his position as Prime Minister by making a recent speech and 'renewing' real support for the idea.\n\nWhen Hirota heard those words from Genrō Saionji Kinmochi, his previously sad mood changed dramatically. He had not even thought of such a consequence of his unknowing act. Now the Genrō himself might well recommend to the Emperor that the leader of the dominant party in the Diet, Rikken Minseitō, be entrusted with the formation of a new government."
 NW_JAP.194.a: "Despite his age, Genrō has proven to be politically astute."
 NW_JAP.195.t: "Past Coup Attempts"
 NW_JAP.195.d: "A series of assassinations of senior politicians and businessmen in early 1932, culminating in the murder of Prime Minister Inukai Tsuyoshi on 15 May, revealed the existence of a secret ultra-nationalist sect led by the self-styled Buddhist preacher Nisshō Inoue. After a number of mystical experiences in 1923-24, he came to believe that Japan needed a spiritual revival and that he was called to be its saviour. He founded a school in Ibaraki Prefecture to promote agrarianism and social reform, which gradually became a training centre for right-wing radicals. He devised the slogan 'ichinin issatsu' ('one person, one kill') and drew up a list of twenty politicians and business leaders whose assassination would be the first step toward restoring supreme political power to the Emperor, a platform known as the 'Shōwa Restoration'.\n\nAt this time, with the help of Mitsuaki Tanaka, former Lord Keeper of the Privy Seal of Japan, he met right-wing figures such as Shūmei Ōkawa and Ikki Kita, and received enthusiastic support from radical young officers at the nearby Tsuchiura naval base. In 1930 Inoue moved to Tokyo, where he set about building the Ketsumeidan organisation by recruiting members among radical university students. The group was officially founded in 1932 with 13 young officers, with the aim of overthrowing the political and economic elite of the time. The group's first wave of assassinations came in early 1932, when former finance minister Junnosuke Inoue was shot dead on 9 February and Baron Dan Takuma, director-general of the Mitsui zaibatsu, was shot dead on 5 March in what made headlines under the general title 'League of Blood Incident'."
 NW_JAP.195.a: "That's where they stopped, right?"
 NW_JAP.196.t: "May 15 incident"
 NW_JAP.196.d: "Inoue was arrested shortly after the last assassination, after which Koga Kiyoshi, a trusted subordinate, took over the reins of the Ketsumeidan and organised a second wave of assassinations, culminating in the murder of Prime Minister Inukai Tsuyoshi on 15 May, an event known as the 'May 15 Incident'.\n\nThe most significant impact of the League of Blood incident came from the trial, which gave Inoue and other defendants a platform from which to disseminate their ultra-nationalist views. Many members of the Japanese public began to sympathise with the conspirators' aims, if not their methods. After this incident, the defendants began to use the defence line of acting in the interests of the Emperor. Abbot Rinzai Gempō Yamamoto testified in favour of his former disciple, justifying his violence from a Zen and imperialist point of view. In November 1934, Inoue and three Ketsumeidan militants were sentenced to life imprisonment.\n\nThe 11 assassins of the Prime Minister were tried by court-martial, but before sentencing the court received a petition signed in blood by 350,000 people throughout Japan in solidarity with the defendants' views and loyalty to the Emperor; later the court received a letter from 11 young men from Niigata who wished to be executed instead of the officers, the envelope containing seven fingers cut off as a sign of the seriousness of their intentions. As a result, they received much lighter sentences, despite the seriousness of their crime."
 NW_JAP.196.a: "And what's Ishiwara's connection with them?"
 NW_JAP.197.t: "Skeleton in the Closet"
 NW_JAP.197.d: "Nissho Inoue was the only one who dared to realise the ideology of Nichirenism, a nationalistic interpretation of the Nichiren doctrine that originated in Japan in the 13th century. Its main populariser was Tanaka Chigaku, a famous orator, writer and propagandist. In 1908 he moved to Miho, Shizuoka Prefecture, where in 1911 he wrote his most famous work, The Doctrine of Saint Nitiren, which presents the radical 13th-century priest Nitiren as the protector of the Japanese nation and calls for the unification of the world through Nitirenism, with the emperor as its nucleus. 'The very purpose of Japan's existence,' he wrote, 'is to realise this plan as a country designed to build Nitiren Buddhism'. In 1914 Tanaka united all his followers into a single organisation, the Kokuchūkai, based in Miho. As he grew older, he became increasingly convinced that Japan's seizure of Manchuria in 1931 was ordained by God and part of a divine plan to spread 'true' Nitiren Buddhism throughout Asia.\n\nKanji Ishiwara joined his followers, such as Nissho Inoue, after his trip to Germany in the 1920s. Partly based on these ideas, Ishiwara formulated his own concept of the 'Last War'. In addition, the notorious ideologue Ikki Kita had close links with Tanaka and his organisation.

 NW_JAP_news.21.d: "Political instability persists in the Empire of Japan. The next prime minister resigned after a lengthy debate in parliament over a new budget plan. The military is demanding an expanded deficit budget in order to increase investment in military industry. It has recently been given a new tool to put pressure on the government - the ability to influence the formation and approval of the cabinet by reinstating the rule that only serving officers can become army ministers. This rule was abolished in 1913 after the country's constitutional crisis. Its return immediately led to a new crisis - the Emperor initially entrusted the formation of a new government to General Ugaki, an influential member of the old generation of the military, whom it was hoped would take control. He was never able to form a cabinet, however, as none of the serving officers agreed to take up the post of war minister. The Japanese people were shocked. Such direct military involvement in civilian government was out of line. General Ugaki was forced to resign in defiance of the Emperor's decree. Another general, Senjuro Hayashi, who met the army's demands, was appointed as the new prime minister."

 NW_JAP_news.22.d: "Fumio Gotō became prime minister of the Empire of Japan. He had already served in an acting capacity during the 26 February coup, and had previously been minister of the interior. He is a representative of the so-called group of 'reformist bureaucrats' in the Japanese government, and some even call him its informal leader. This faction represents the best of the bureaucracy, educated in Germany and the USA and partly influenced by the planned economy of the USSR. They have a plan to change the state system so that power is transferred to the most capable top managers (i.e. themselves) and the economy is rid of the concept of 'laissez-faire'. However, it is likely that the number of opponents of such a concept far outweighs the number of supporters."

His rule was marked by an attempt to replace the unstable political system with a new, technocratic one that the reformist bureaucrats had long been planning among themselves. However, the excessive radicalism they showed in trying to implement their project and the discontent of many politicians led to another change of prime minister and the entire cabinet, and with it buried all the hopes of the reformist bureaucrats for power."

It is also worth noting that almost none of these people were connected to the zaibatsu. Rather, small and medium-sized businessmen who had invested in Manchukuo while Kishi was in Manchuria, or who had benefited from government contracts when Kishi was deputy minister of armaments, joined the new party, as did executives of the 'public policy corporations' Kishi had set up to invest in Manchukuo, and even some ultra-nationalists who had been involved in coup attempts."

In addition, the MPs are clearly trying to gain support from 'outside', as they realise that the concentration of power in the hands of the bureaucracy will displease many political circles.\n\nHowever, there is still a chance that the bill will be passed, thanks to the political party that Hiroya Ino has formed in the name of his mentor, Nobusuke Kishi. It will require a reshuffled cabinet headed by Hiroya, who has built up a good reputation in the Diet, unlike Fumio Gotō, who has little contact with members of the House of Representatives.

Seishirō Itagaki was to be Minister of War; Suetsugu Nobumasa, an admiral with radical reformist leanings, was chosen as Minister of the Navy; either Yōsuke Matsuoka or Toshio Shiratori was acceptable as Minister of Foreign Affairs; industrialist Seihin Ikeda was their choice to head the Ministry of Finance; Shingo Tsuda, Minister of Trade and Industry; Shinji Sogō, Chief Cabinet Secretary; and Masayoshi Miyazaki, Chairman of the Future Cabinet Planning Council.\n\nAs can be seen from the personalities, almost all of them are close associates of the influential Colonel Kanji Ishiwara, who has been trying for months to push through his plan to reform the political system under the name of the 'National Defence State'. Despite his popularity, Ishiwara is so intent on maintaining his status as a grey eminence that he has refused to accept any ministerial posts.\n\nThe appointment of such a cabinet means that Hayashi will have to submit almost completely to the influence of the Manchurian faction, but does the old general have a choice?"

Upon hearing this, Shinji Sogō, who had hoped to become the official organiser of the 'Manchurian Cabinet', tried unsuccessfully to prevent Hayashi from meeting with the emissaries of Umezu's group. In the end, Hayashi rejected most of the names put forward by the Manchurian faction, and instead of Itagaki and Suetsugu he chose Ketare Nakamura and Mitsumasa Yonai, who had been chosen by the top brass of the army and navy. Kanji Ishiwara has been understandably upset.\n\nSogō, furious with Hayashi, demanded that Hayashi immediately refuse the emperor's request to form a government, and Ishiwara himself, accompanied by Asahara, is said to have urged the old general to protest against the composition of his cabinet. But Hayashi stood firm. Disgusted, the leaders of the Manchurian faction met and decided to have nothing more to do with supporting Hayashi's government. The attempt to form a 'Manchurian Cabinet' failed, and with it the Manchurian faction and much of Ishiwara's influence."

 NW_JAP.208.t: "Criticism of the Government in Parliament"
 NW_JAP.208.d: "Criticism of the current government of General Hayashi has become more frequent in Parliament. Deputies make insulting statements in his direction and require him to take into account the views of parliament when implementing his policy. It comes to bickering right during the Prime Minister's speech at the Seimas. It is believed that this mutual discontent has intensified against the background of a feeling of "abandonment" of parliament by the government, as Hayashi deliberately formed his already small cabinet without the participation of parliamentary politicians.\n\nAll this is unacceptable for our state at such a crucial time, especially since parliamentary regimes are disappearing from the scene all over the world and giving way to modern states. Hayashi has long been planning to "punish" the parliamentary parties, especially the two main and dominant ones: Rikken Seiyūkai and Rikken Minseitō, which are the locomotives of Hayashi's resistance. The Prime Minister believes that it is time to dissolve parliament and hold new elections, which should be won by supporters of the current course, who support reforms and the general's cabinet."

The Lord Keeper of the Privy Seal, Yuasa Kurahei, gathered the opinions of senior government officials on this matter, but first of all he still asked about genrō's position. Saionji Kinmochi made two recommendations in this regard. Such a person can now become the young prince Fumimaro Konoe, who was trained all his life by Saionji himself for a position of exactly this level. Another candidate may be the gray cardinal Kiichirō Hiranuma, who has long coveted the post of head of the Cabinet of Ministers."

 NW_JAP.211.d: "The Shōwakai Party was founded in December 1935 by a group of 18 Diet members who had left the Rikken Seiyūkai Party after its leaders decided not to support Admiral Okada's cabinet. This was followed by several expulsions from the party for collaborating with the old party, and a fairly successful electoral performance for the new party - it won 20 seats in 1936. In the last election the number was reduced to 19. This uncertainty among voters, as well as the apparent meaninglessness of this party's independence after the change of government, led the leaders of the Shōwakai to announce today that they would reunite with the Rikken Seiyūkai."

 NW_JAP.212.d: "In October 1930, the Shōwa Kenkyūkai (Shōwa Research Association), a political think tank, was established as an informal organisation to study and evaluate issues related to the Meiji Constitution and current political problems. Its leader, Ryūnosuke Gotō, is a close friend and associate of Prime Minister Konoe, which is why some refer to the Shōwa Kenkyūkai as Konoe's think tank.\n\nThe membership of the Shōwa Kenkyūkai was deliberately diverse to avoid political bias. It included a wide range of scholars, journalists, bankers, businessmen and military officers. The exceptions were politicians and bureaucrats. As a result, the group was heavily skewed towards leftists and Marxists. For the same reason, in the course of their work they came to believe that liberal democracy was outdated, that parliament should be replaced by a corporate assembly, and that the economy should be built on more command and control principles.\n\nAlso today, on the initiative of the personal secretaries of Prime Minister Tomohiko Ushiba and Michizo Kishi, a small think-tank is being formed under the unofficial name of "Asameshikai" ("Breakfast Society"). The idea was to meet twice a month for breakfast at around eight o'clock in the morning. Over a meal, the members of the society would be free to discuss many confidential matters in the interest of Konoe. The Breakfast Society is an ideal place for a confidential and frank exchange of views on domestic and international matters. It should be stressed, however, that even the meetings of such high-ranking officials did not escape the increased scrutiny of the intelligence services, especially because of the critical number of leftists among them."

After years of rule and covert influence, the old politician has found someone he can trust to lead the country. Although Kimmochi and Konoe's political views have diverged in recent years, the genrō believes he has taught his mentee to make the right decisions for the nation in the current global situation.\n\nThus, one of the oldest institutions of power in the post-Meiji Empire, the genrōs, who until the last days determined the vector of the country's domestic policy by advising the emperor on whom to appoint as prime minister, will cease to function. It remains to be seen whether Hirohito is ready to take on such a responsibility, or whether he will continue to consult his inner circle on such an important issue."

Following the example of the Hayashi government, the Konoe cabinet adopted a moderate tone in foreign policy. The government took the position that the implementation of a new programme of economic and military preparedness would be best achieved by avoiding premature conflicts with either the Anglo-American powers or the Chinese nationalist movement. Konoe was equally peace-loving in his domestic policies. To placate reformist sympathisers, he invited Eiichi Baba back into the government as Minister of the Interior, but to appease business interests he gave key posts in the Ministries of Finance and Trade to career bureaucrats Okinori Kaya and Shinji Yoshino."

 NW_JAP.214.d: "The main residence of the Fumimaro Konoe family is an apartment in the Mejiro district of central Tokyo, but a few months before becoming prime minister, Konoe purchased a villa in the Ogikubo district of Suginami, a rural suburb of Tokyo. The villa had previously belonged to Irisawa Tatsukichi, chief physician of the Ministry of the Imperial Court during the Taishō period and head of the Faculty of Medicine at Tokyo Imperial University. It was built by the famous architect of the Meiji era, Itō Chūta. It features high ceilings as Irisawa promoted a western lifestyle, and an important change for him was the ability to sit at a high table on chairs rather than on the floor as was traditional in Japanese homes. There are also some exotic design details in the interior, reflecting Itō's travels to China, India and the Middle East.\n\nAfter buying it, Konoe redesigned the interior in a more Japanese style and added a kura, a traditional building used for storage. The villa is surrounded by 6,000 square metres of gardens. Konoe's chief preceptor, genrō Saionji Kinmochi, was invited to be the first guest in the new house. He slowly walked around the estate, looked at the gardens and named it Tekigai-sō. The Prince had originally intended to use it as a summer residence, but he liked the views and the rural tranquillity so much that he began to spend most of his time here. He even held his first press conference with journalists here in Ogikubo after his appointment as Prime Minister."

All socialists have tried to dissociate themselves from communism in order not to be associated with this movement.\n\nOn the other hand, those who know Konoe well might have expected something like this, as his circle of close friends has always included a few Communists or former Communist Party members or sympathisers."

His loyal pupil Fumimaro Konoe could not stay away, especially as he was the same age as his daughter and they were also good friends.\n\nWhen most of the guests had gathered at Saionji's house, a black car pulled up. Its side door opened and, crouching down, stepped out... Adolf Hitler. Or rather, Fumimaro Konoe, who had dressed up as Hitler and even made his fringes look like the famous ones of the German Fuehrer (he has been trimming his moustache the same way for a long time). This was no longer news to the 90-year-old liberal Saionji. He had long realised that his 'heir''s political views differed from his own."

The Rikken Minseitō representatives were more fortunate, as the militants failed to break into their building, but were blocked by them inside. The militants are demanding that the party's members declare self-dissolution in support of the One Party Movement, arguing that the party's outdated ideological stance will only relegate it to the pages of history and that it should not interfere with the country's development.\n\nThe telephones at the Metropolitan Police Station have been ringing off the hook all day with persistent calls from the seized party offices. Indifferent onlookers have gathered outside the police, Parliament and party offices to watch the latest incident unfold.

He took full responsibility for what had happened. There is a remarkable silence in the newspapers - either everyone is in a wild state of confusion, or they do not want to risk the dissolution of the Government if the consequences of the incident are exaggerated, or they are lost in speculation as to what secret and invisible political struggle has been going on all this time that has led to such an incident, remotely reminiscent of some of the events of recent years perpetrated by military radicals.

He is also a close friend of Prime Minister Konoe and Lord Keeper of the Privy Seal Kōichi Kido, all three of whom are young aristocrats.\n\nToday's incident proves this intimacy between Konoe and Harada: Harada paid a surprise visit to the Prime Minister's residence late at night on important business, only to be warned that the Prince had already gone to bed. So he went straight to the bedroom and discovered that Konoe was actually sleeping with Harada's wife. Harada, who had often complained to Konoe about his bad relations with women, kicked his wife out of the bedroom and lay down on the futon with Konoe, having secret talks until morning."

 NW_JAP.251.d: "The leaders of both factions of the Rikken Seiyūkai Party, Fusanosuke Kuhara, Ichirō Hitoyama, and Chikuhei Nakajima, despite what appeared to be major disagreements within their party, proclaimed the self-dissolution of one of the oldest parliamentary parties, following their Shakai Taishūtō counterparts. For Kuhara and Hitoyama, this is the beginning of the realization of their long-held plans to establish a “one state, one party” ideology. Nakajima, on the other hand, realizes that his faction and party have too little political clout to oppose the prime minister's decision."

 NW_JAP.253.t: "Dissolution of Minsaitō"
 NW_JAP.253.d: "The last hope of democracy, Rikken Minsaitō, resisted almost the longest in parliament, but was also forced to make concessions under threat of being banned from the party. In any case, there was no other way, and its leader, Machuda Chūji, legally announced its dissolution."
 NW_JAP.253.a: "What was he hoping for..."
 NW_JAP.254.t: "Dissolution of the Great Japan Youth Party"
 NW_JAP.254.d: "Colonel Kingoro Hashimoto, as well as Seigō Nakano, was very afraid of losing his own party, and therefore he was reluctant to dissolve it (although his party has no seats in the parliament), but for the necessary effect its dissolution was also necessary. This problem was solved in the same way as with Tōhōkai - its leader was promised a place in the future organization, or rather for Hashimoto - he was promised to give the leadership over the youth wing of the future organization."
 NW_JAP.254.a: "The last bastion has fallen"
 NW_JAP.255.t: "Relations with the State Apparatus"
 NW_JAP.255.d: "According to the kokutai concept, the new state structure created by the prime minister of the country should become a political analog of the “state organism”: the emperor is assigned a place above it, and the prime minister himself becomes the head as his authorized representative in politics. However, the question of relations with the state apparatus immediately arises: will the “new structure” be a mass socio-political movement independent of the state or a para-state structure under the control of the bureaucracy? In the first case, the movement will be able to subordinate the apparatus itself, and in the second case it will be subordinated to it. We will have to make this difficult choice, respectively gaining or losing the support of various politicians, military and financial groups."
 NW_JAP.255.a: "Let's evaluate the different options"
 NW_JAP.256.t: "Proponents of the Radical Project"
 NW_JAP.256.d: "In the camp of supporters of the organization's radical project are those individuals who throughout the 1930s tried to change Japan's political system in various ways. These include military officers who tried to organize plots and coups, such as Kingoro Hashimoto. These include parliamentary politicians who wanted to do the same, but through more legal methods with the help of the House of Representatives - journalist Seigō Nakano and others. This group also includes Prince Fumimaro Konoe and his inner circle from the “think-tank” and some reformist bureaucrats who saw an opportunity to implement their plans with the help of the new organization: Fumio Gotō, Naoki Hoshino and Kishi Nobosuke."
 NW_JAP.256.a: "A lot of people want to make a change"
 NW_JAP.257.t: "Proponents of the Moderate Project"
 NW_JAP.257.d: "There is also another faction of supporters of the “new structure” - these are the more moderate politicians from the entourage of Kiichirō Hiranuma and his dissolved Kokuhonsha Society. However, their moderation is due to their political intentions: They do not need the “new structure” for any changes in the country, but as a tool to strengthen their personal power, to eliminate the changeability of power, or they are those politicians who want to get into ministerial seats with its help. They are mostly representatives of the Seiyūkai Party in the parliament."
 NW_JAP.257.a: "And how will these two groups be able to implement something working?"
 NW_JAP.258.t: "The Imperial Rule Assistance Association"
 NW_JAP.258.d: "Today, the Imperial Rule Assistance Association was officially established - that was the name of the “new political structure”. An official declaration of its objectives was also issued, but the words about the upcoming activities were so vague that these events did not arouse much enthusiasm, and on the contrary began to undermine the authority of the organization. The Prime Minister [ROOT.GetLeader] during his speech at the first meeting of the Committee for the preparation of the new structure emphasized the “supraparty” nature of the Association."
 NW_JAP.258.a: "Let's move on to addressing the real issues"
 NW_JAP.259.t: "The New Economic Structure Project"
 NW_JAP.259.d: "In an attempt to find a balance between the radicals and moderates in the composition of the Association for the Help of the Throne, the Prime Minister [ROOT.GetLeader] decided to keep the supporters of both visions of the structure so that they could prove the better of the two points of view while working out concrete solutions. And the first issue that the members of the Association moved to discuss was the draft of the “new economic structure” prepared by the Shōwa Research Association. It envisages a rather strong intervention of the Association in the work of the economy, a long-awaited transition to totalitarianism and the introduction of planned elements."
 NW_JAP.259.a: "We need to try our best to overcome the resistance of moderate circles"
 NW_JAP.260.t: "Adoption of a New Economic Structure"
 NW_JAP.260.d: "Despite great resistance from some of the elites within the state, we managed to get the draft of the new economic structure accepted at the meeting of the Imperial Rule Assistance Association. In this way, the new political structure proves its viability and also begins the formation of a new system of state governance."
 NW_JAP.260.a: "Did it really work?"
 NW_JAP.261.t: "Rejection of the New Economic Structure"
 NW_JAP.261.d: "The project of a new economic structure was too radical for most of the elites of our state and was not accepted by the Imperial Rule Assistance Association after long debates and negotiations. At some point, the business community stopped funding the Association because of its work on this plan to interfere with the economy."
 NW_JAP.261.a: "It seems that not even the Association can break the existing orders in the state...."
 NW_JAP.262.t: "The Case of the Reds"
 NW_JAP.262.d: "Kempeitai raided the Ministry of Commerce and Industry today, arresting almost all of the original authors of the draft of the new economic structure. The secret police justified the operation because of the suspicion that these bureaucrats 'sympathize with socialist and communist ideas' and 'want to undermine the state system,' for which the incident has been dubbed 'the case of the Reds' in the media.\n\n\n\nThis is a severe blow to the reputation of the Imperial Rule Assistance Association, as it was commissioned to draft the new economic structure. It is said that operation Kempeitai was initiated by opponents of the plan, so it is hoped that those arrested will be released quickly."
 NW_JAP.262.a: "It seems the repressive machine is out of control"
 NW_JAP.263.t: "Repressive Amendments to Laws"
 NW_JAP.263.d: "At the initiative of the Privy Council, the House of Representatives passed further repressive amendments to existing laws on the protection of the state system. This is a clear signal to those who wanted to remake the system of government to suit themselves with the help of the Imperial Rule Assistance Association. And it seems to be the final stroke in its helplessness. Recently, Kiichirō Hiranuma, a possible initiator of these amendments to the law, stated that the Association is not a “political” but only a “public” organization, despite earlier comments by other politicians."
 NW_JAP.263.a: "The moderate forces have won"
 NW_JAP.264.t: "Reforming the Association"
 NW_JAP.264.d: "The leadership of the Imperial Rule Assistance Association, headed by Yoriyasu Arima, resigned due to the circumstances of its functioning, or rather dysfunctionality. After this, Kiichirō Hiranuma was finally able to reform the Association in accordance with his plans for it to be a “public” rather than a “political” organization: the political, planning, and parliamentary bureaus of the Association were abolished, and its prefectural offices were reassigned to governors, i.e. the Ministry of the Interior."
 NW_JAP.264.a: "The Association has finally become an auxiliary body of the bureaucracy"
 NW_JAP.265.t: "The Resignation of the Radicals"
 NW_JAP.265.d: "The Prime Minister [ROOT.GetLeader] dismissed the last supporters of the radical vision of the Imperial Rule Assistance Association from among the reformist bureaucrats, Naoki Hoshino and Kishi Nobosuke. Their place was taken by the influential industrialist Ogura Masatsune. However, to maintain bureaucratic balance, the project's main economic opponent, Kobayashi Ichizo, also resigned. Now the Imperial Rule Assistance Association has finally become a screen and shadow of its planned greatness - Japan continues to exist as if it never existed."
 NW_JAP.265.a: "Twice the pride, double the fall."
 NW_JAP.266.t: "Government Resignation"
 NW_JAP.266.d: "[ROOT.GetLeader] announced his resignation as prime minister because the political climate in the country has changed too much. Obviously, this is just the “tip of the iceberg” of the political struggle that has been unfolding over the past months among the elites. It is over and the time has come to create a new government based on the existing political arrangements - based on the agenda of the supporters of the status quo, represented by their informal leader Kiichirō Hiranuma. Or, on the other hand, the failure of the reformers is a chance to take the path of returning to parliamentary politics, as all attempts at reform in the country have proven to be a failure. In such a case, it is worth appointing the leader of the former conservative parties in parliament as prime minister."

Some analysts are already making loud claims that with this appointment Japan is finally on the path to war. In addition, Tojo is the first prime minister in a long time who decided to combine at once ministerial posts from his own cabinet on himself. And what is more, he did not leave the active army, which is also a violation of the traditions of Japanese politics."

 NW_JAP.267.d: "Tojo's longtime political foe, the indefatigable Kanji Ishiwara, made a public statement in a newspaper today that he condemns Prime Minister Tojo as an enemy of Japan who should be “arrested and executed.” The outspoken move, but made most likely out of powerlessness to influence the political situation, proved to be the last line for Ishiwara. Their conflict comes to an end - Tojo takes this opportunity to send his old rival finally into retirement, something he has long dreamed of. Ishiwara is said to have announced that he will return to his native Yamagata, where he will continue to write his works and study agriculture."

He was known in Europe in the 20s for his extravagant behavior for a member of the monarchical house, but with the onset of the Great Depression he returned to Japan, joined the army and headed one of the units on the islands. He gradually became involved in politics in the 1930s, but he became actively involved in politics when the radical military, which was trying to start a war, became extremely influential. His arrival as Prime Minister means a great risk for the Chrysanthemum Throne, as now the Imperial dynasty is directly involved in political issues, and all responsibility for the future rests on the Prince's shoulders.

 NW_JAP.273.d: "After our army captured the Chinese capital Nanjing, mass uncontrolled crimes by soldiers and officers began in the city: rape, looting, arson and murders, including of civilians. The situation is complicated by the fact that despite the evacuations in the city remain representatives of European countries in the so-called “Nanjing Security Zone”, created by German businessman Jon Rabe. He and American missionary Luis Smythe are recording everything that is happening and have already filed complaints with our embassy. Journalists, including Japanese journalists and those officially allowed into the war zone by the army leadership, are adding fuel to the fire. For example, the case, which was covered by two Japanese newspapers, when two officers on the approach to Nanjing competed to be the first to slaughter 100 people with a sword - and their competition continued after this mark was reached, has already become widely known. If this massacre was not stopped, the morale of the troops would finally collapse and Japan would be irreparably damaged internationally. Since two members of the Imperial Family, Prince Kotohito and Prince Yasuhiko, are responsible for the capture of Nanking, the press may leak information about it, which would further damage the reputation of the Imperial Family."

 NW_JAP.288.d: "Today, the worst thing imaginable at the moment had happened - one of the crazed junior officers from the army had made an assassination attempt on Admiral Yamamoto after all. Despite the so-called 'guards' assigned to him by the senior army officers, the admiral's safety was not properly ensured. Somehow, a land officer who had absolutely nothing to do with the local naval base managed to infiltrate it with a cold weapon and deliver a sneak attack, from which Yamamoto died almost on the spot. The news of this was a heavy blow to all who knew the admiral well. During an urgently convened government conference attended by the army minister, he was reprimanded by the emperor - an incredible gesture from the usually calm and composed monarch:\n\n- This is not just a blow to the Imperial Navy, it is a blow to the Imperial family and the emperor himself! It is likely that such harshness is due to Yamamoto's well-known closeness to the reigning monarch. It is expected that a solemn state funeral will be organized in the near future."
 NW_JAP.288.a: "This is a major blow to the entire country"
 NW_JAP.289.t: "Yamamoto Threats"
 NW_JAP.289.d: "The hatred of army officers for their naval counterparts continues to grow. Admiral Yamamoto is receiving an endless stream of hate mail from his opponents, as well as direct threats from Japanese nationalists, but he is very calm about the possibility of an attempt on his life. In an interview with reporters, he said:\n\n\n- To die for the Emperor and the Motherland is the highest honor for a military man. Flowers rise in the field where a hard, brave battle was fought. And even under the threat of death, a fighting man will be eternally loyal to the emperor and his land. The life and death of one man means nothing. The empire comes first. As Confucius said, “You can crush cinnabar, but you can't take away its color; you can burn flowers, but you can't destroy their scent.” They can destroy my body, but they can never subdue my will.\n\n\n\n0 Recently, senior army officers ordered the military police to “guard” the admiral. Many speculate that in reality, this is an attempt to 'keep him under control' because of his unwavering stance on the alliance with Germany.”"
 NW_JAP.289.a: "It's worth sending the Admiral to sea to save him from assassination attempts."
 NW_JAP.290.t: "The Conflict Between the Navy and the Army"
 NW_JAP.290.d: "During the past year a large number of army and navy officers have begun to speak out publicly against certain Japanese admirals. Isoroku Yamamoto, Mitsumasa Yonai, and Shigeyoshi Inoue have been particularly criticized because of their strong disapproval of a possible alliance with Germany and because of their opposition to plans to seize the “southern resource zone.” For example, Admiral Yamamoto Yamamoto did not personally support the invasion of Manchuria in 1931.\n/p Politically, he was in favor of a peaceful solution to all conflicts. He was strongly opposed to war with the United States, a position that came out of his training at Harvard, his service as an assistant admiral, and his service as naval attaché (twice) in Washington. He attended the second London Naval Conference in 1930 with the rank of Rear Admiral, and already with the rank of Vice Admiral at the London Naval Conference of 1934. The Japanese government believed that the cadre military specialist must accompany diplomats during the discussion of arms reduction.\n\n \n\nThe popularity of Yamamoto in the navy is incredibly high - he is loved by ordinary sailors and officers, as he has always treated them with deep respect. In addition, Admiral Yamamoto and Admiral Yonai have close ties to the Imperial Family, which further enhances their influence."

 NW_JAP.291.d: "Sayonji Kimmochi, who once considered Konoe as his protégé in resolving the political conflict, has left this world. Perhaps this explains the radical nature of the proposals that Prince Konoe has made. There was now no genro representative left to advise the emperor on the appointment of a prime minister during such a difficult period. Instead, the new Lord Keeper of the Privy Seal, Kōichi Kido, canvassed the opinions of all former prime ministers as high-ranking statesmen (the so-called jushichi).\n\n\n\nThey quickly agreed that the army's position left no room for the appointment of anyone other than Prince Konoe. Before formally accepting the post of prime minister, Konoe held an extensive round of political discussions at his residence with the men who would occupy key positions in his cabinet: Foreign Minister Yosuke Matsuoka, Navy Minister Yoshida Zengo, and Army Minister Hideki Tojo.\n/pThese talks were designed to maximize Konoe's influence over his cabinet. They were held under the veiled threat that Konoe would reject the emperor's offer to lead the government if his key ministers were unwilling to support his political views. Satisfied that this maneuver led to agreement, Konoe quickly formed his cabinet."
 NW_JAP.291.a: "Sly move"
 NW_JAP.292.t: "Konoe's Idea"
 NW_JAP.292.d: "More often than not, during Breakfast Society meetings, if Prince Konoe was present, he was usually silent, as if parodying the Emperor's behavior at Government Ministerial Conferences. Today's meeting, however, went drastically out of the ordinary. Konoe was suddenly the first to break the silence after the meeting began, beginning to speak of his views on the upcoming changes in the country's political structure. The prince argued that the institutional weakness of the premiership limited the prime minister's ability to control the political activities of the military. The political settlement during the Meiji period had deprived the cabinet of leverage in choosing between the priorities of the army and navy or in reconciling the military's views on national policy with those of other elite groups.\n\n\n To cope with these problems, Konoe proposed the establishment of a new political order in Japan. The cornerstone of the new system was to be a new political party that would unite all existing groups in the lower house, but would be led by himself as president. By holding the posts of party leader and prime minister simultaneously, Konoe believed he could strengthen the prime minister's position of control over the people, the lower house, the bureaucracy, and the military. Based on mass organization, the new party would provide channels for mobilizing people in the service of cabinet policies. The political leverage that the prime minister could gain through the support of the new party would strengthen his bargaining position with both the bureaucracy and the military."
 NW_JAP.292.a: "Finally waited... The prince realized what was expected of him"
 NW_JAP.293.t: "On Muted Tones"
 NW_JAP.293.d: "When Konoe finished his detailed plan of action in the event that he became prime minister, the people present were afraid to even speak for fear of scaring away the prince's fighting spirit that everyone had been waiting for. The prolonged silence was interrupted again by Konoe himself:\n\n\n- My plans will require a fundamental.... ahem. reinterpretation of the Meiji Constitution, which was designed specifically to ensure that power is distributed among several elite groups, rather than concentrated in the hands of a single individual or political party. - he spoke in a muffled voice, as if embarrassed by each successive word."

Baseball is a game that came to Japan from the United States, but has become a favorite of many urban dwellers in recent times. Previously, there were individual games between national teams, but now everything is organized at the national and official level with financial support from outside.\n\n\n\nThe radical military from the Kōdōha faction and some Japanese politicians are in favor of banning this sport as a “Western”, but it has a large number of supporters among very different influential politicians and businessmen. For example, Arima Yoriyasu, a close friend of Prince Konoe, a reformer, created his own team, the Tokyo Senators, similar to the American Washingtone Senators. Arima is also a major lobbyist and advocate in political circles.\n\n\nThe current season will be played by 7 teams: 3 from Tokyo, 2 from Osaka, 2 from Nagoya. It is also worth noting the international nature of the Japanese League - several teams are played by Americans, including blacks who could not find a decent place in their homeland because of the policy of segregation, and even one Russian immigrant - Victor Starfin."

 NW_JAP.299.d: "“Fertility hell” became a well-known phrase during the Great Shōwa Depression. The term, literally meaning the painful life caused by having many children, suggests the common perception of having many children as a symbol of an unhappy life. In reality, however, fertility was seen as a pressing issue among the lower class, who suffered from poverty and unemployment. Newspapers began to mention infanticide in both urban and rural areas. To cope with this population growth, the proletarian movement spread the idea of birth control or helping workers and the poor to solve this problem. Since 1934, representatives of the leftist movement have opened Birth Control Advisory Centers in major cities. They are headed by a feminist, Katō Shizue, who, after studying in the West, has absorbed a lot of left-liberal ideas. She argues that the problem of Japan's growing population can be solved by women. She believes that giving women control over their own reproduction will allow women to achieve greater independence and also allow for a society in which women take the lead. Another part of her argument is that birth control will help the people of Japan raise better children. She thinks that by having fewer children, women will be able to create better educational and economic opportunities for their children. In keeping with the “influence and respectability of eugenics,” Katō Shizue also supports eugenics, believing that children born to two healthy parents will be better off than children born to sick or weak parents. Such ideas may become too popular in society and lead us eventually to population decline, and thus inevitable defeat in competition with other, more numerous nations such as the Chinese, Russians or Americans. Now, due to the outbreak of hostilities, we have an official reason to isolate Katō from public life and close her Counseling Center."

At the time of the active confrontation between Tōseiha and Kōdōha, the country was still a blank slate on which anyone could write, draw, or implement a new system. And in the end, in a completely unexpected way, through the strengthening of the democratic government, the country turned into the very oligarchy firmly connected to the military of the Tōseiha faction.

 NW_JAP.323.d: "The preparatory committee began its activities with a banquet at which wild boar stew prepared by Tōhōkai members from Kumamoto City was served. During the banquet, major newspaper owners Tokutomi and Miyake, Shakai Taishutō general secretary Hisashi Asō and Nakano himself spoke. Tiamu, the third “Grand Elder” among prominent Japanese newspaper owners, was dissuaded from attending by fellow members of the Japanist camp, such as representatives of the Great Japan Production Party and the Kokurikai, who jointly accused Nakano of seeking to establish a “totalitarian unified national party of the Western pattern.” Thus, for a time, Nakano and Tiamu were once again separated by this kind of conflict, despite their recent restoration of relations.\n/pThe Preparatory Committee made some progress by choosing the name “Kakushin Shintō” (New Renewal Party), drafting a platform, and setting a date for the inaugural meeting. The platform stated:\n\n\n1. In accordance with the basic principle of the founding of the nation, the national spirit of the Japanese people will be strengthened by contributing to the development of world culture;\n\n\n2. With the reform of capitalism, a new economic structure will be established that is in the common public interest;\n\n\n3. A new order will be established in East Asia and international relations will be reorganized."

 NW_JAP.324.d: "The leaders of the Japanese Reformist Village Council, Arima Yoriyasu and Akira Kazami, agreed to join the new party with their organization, which probably could not have happened without the approval of Prince Konoe himself, with whom Arima and Kazami have been actively involved lately. Akira, himself a member of the Kokumin Dōmei and “third” among its leaders after Adachi and Nakano, proved to be a successful link between Konoe and Nakano, despite the latter's initial negative reaction to the rise of his recent partner."

 NW_JAP.325.t: "A New Renovationist Party has Been Formed"
 NW_JAP.325.d: "A most unusual and unexpected change occurred in the political landscape of the parliament - instead of the typical splits, parties that seemed to be on opposite sides of the political spectrum merged: the fascist Tohokai Party and the only socialist party, Shakai Taishūtō. They were also joined by individual deputies from other factions. The united party was called the Kakushin Shinto New Renewal Party, with the irrepressible Seigō Nakano at its head. It is quite possible that such a reshuffle will change the situation in the parliament after the next elections."

 NW_JAP.326.t: "Tension in Negotiations"
 NW_JAP.326.d: "The real possibility of forming a strong new party coalition in parliament could not help but strain other politicians. Rival movements attempted to undermine the formation of the New Renewal Party among the less committed elements in Shakai Taishūtō. The resulting tensions came to a head over the issue of the principal officers of the new party. The Shakai Taishūtō expected one of its leaders to be given the top position due to the larger number of members of parliament, but Nakano felt that since the basic principle was totalism and the Shakai Taishūtō was joining as a group of “rejects” of socialism, Nakano himself should be the main man in the new party. As a compromise, the possibility of Prince Konoe leading the new party is being considered."

Shakai Taishūtō expected one of its leaders to be given the top position because of the larger number of members of parliament, but Nakano felt that since the basic principle was totalism and Shakai Taishūtō was joining as a group of those who had “renounced” socialism, Nakano himself should be the main man in the new party."

The resulting tensions came to a head over the issue of the principal officers of the new party.

However, during the difficult final negotiations, the parties reached a compromise: Seigō Nakano and Abe Isu would establish a system of collective presidency in the party. Hisashi Asō will retain the post of secretary-general under them."

 NW_JAP.329.d: "Ryūtarō Nagai, one of the high-profile leaders of the Rikken Minseitō Party, concerned about the formation of a new major party alliance, decided to pursue a similar project of his own. He announced the need to create a counterweight to the “emerging forces” in the Seim in order to maintain bipartisan politics in the Seim. It is already known that he is negotiating with several factions, as well as within his own party, to create a new party based on Rikken Minseitō."

 NW_JAP.330.d: "Despite earlier refusals to take over as leader of one of the new parliamentary parties, Fumimaro Konoe has now responded in the affirmative to a request from the leaders of Shakai Taishūtō and Tōhōkai to lead their alliance, Kakushin Shintō. Apparently this is because the prince has realized that in order to take the position of prime minister, the easiest way to do so in the current situation is through the Seim and a massively popular party."
 NW_JAP.330.a: "Let's see what happens"
 NW_JAP.331.t: "Joint Statement"
 NW_JAP.331.d: "Nakano was closer than ever to forming a mass movement, but the public was not yet ready for such a movement. Tōhōkai and Shakai Taishūtō could not agree on the leadership issue, but they issued a joint statement saying they would continue to maintain “friendly relations between the parties with an eye toward future possibilities.” This was a problem of the same kind that had prevented the formation of the February Society as the basis of the right-wing Renewalist association in 1936. Various names, structures and leadership candidates were proposed in search of a compromise, but a joint leadership meeting convinced them that the time had not yet come, as they put it in a joint statement."
 NW_JAP.331.a: "The creation of a totalitarian party has completely failed. Completely!"
 NW_JAP.332.t: "Nakano Commentary"
 NW_JAP.332.d: "After the failure to form a new party, journalists could not leave the Tōhōkai leader alone, even though he had previously made statements. As a result, the irascible Nakano could not help himself and began making new comments that contradicted what he had previously said. For example, he said that the possibility of an alliance with Shakai Taishūtō in the future has now been ruled out. In addition, he said that the experience had extinguished in him “the last spark of hope for parliament-centered political maneuvers.” At the end of the interview, he revealed some very intriguing news:\n\n\n- I have decided to directly address the realization of the crisis in Japan and fight for the establishment of a totalitarian Imperial Way Party."
 NW_JAP.332.a: "The imperial way? Kōdōha again?"
 NW_JAP.333.t: "The National Front Goes On"
 NW_JAP.333.d: "Although it seemed that the Nakano scandal had put an end to the story of parliamentary party mergers, Shakai Taishūtō leaders decided not to abandon the idea, given that there are other parties besides Tōhōkai Nakano that have expressed their agreement to merge during past negotiations. Thus, Nakano's old colleague, Adachi Kenzō, agreed to continue the party merger talks, as did smaller associations and individual lawmakers and organizations. In the end, all of these movements agreed to merge into a single party under the same name, “Kakushin Shintō,” already proposed at one time."
 NW_JAP.333.a: "Nakano has written himself out of this story"
 NW_JAP.334.t: "Nakano's Visit to the Front"
 NW_JAP.334.d: "A few days later, Nakano went on a visit to the front with the approval of the War Minister. This was undoubtedly to divert attention from the party merger fiasco. However, on the way, still very agitated, he spoke sharply in another press interview about politics being in a "state of paralysis". Because of this and his sudden departure during a Sejm session, movements began among the two main parties to expel him from the Sejm. His own support in parliament was quickly eroded after the merger fiasco, and in the end only four Tohokai deputies remained party members. Much of this collapse was attributed to Nakano's excessive admiration for European fascist leaders, his close identification with the army line, and his generally dictatorial views - traits that many in his party hoped would be mitigated by the merger with Shakai Taishuto.\n\nOn his return to Japan, he found that he had no choice but to resign from the Diet. He rejected any suggestion that he might apologize from leaders of various parties. In a public statement, he said:\n\n- The recent failure was my ultimate disappointment in the new party, which is projected to rely on members of the Seimas, and I take full responsibility for this. Given these circumstances, I have now decided to resign from the Sejm and throw myself naked into the thick of the masses."

 NW_JAP.335.t: "Kokumin Domei joins Ryutaro's movement"
 NW_JAP.335.d: "After the first news of the National Front promoted by Nakano, the first party to be negotiated with by Shakai Taishuto and Tohokai was Kokumin Domei, the party from which Nakano had left in 1936 because of ideological differences. Rumors had already appeared in the newspapers that the failure of those negotiations was due to Ryutaro's secret machinations, during which he promised Adachi Kenzo, the leader of Kokumin Domei, the creation of a different party coalition, more popular in parliament and without Seigo Nakano, his rival. Ryutaro was now able to confirm these words - Adachi had agreed to his proposal to join. The newspapers had already dubbed this news as "Kokumin Domei returns to the Rikken Minseito", since until 1932 Adachi and his co-partisans had made up the so-called "Adachi faction" within the Minseito."

 NW_JAP.336.t: "Nakajima Joins Ryutaro's Movement"
 NW_JAP.336.d: "Ryutaro Nagai's movement to form a new major party based on Rikken Minshito managed to surprise by having Chikuhei Nakajima's Innovation Alliance, who had been expelled from the Rikken Seiyukai Party, agree to join. Against the backdrop of fighting other parties and in order to establish a solid majority in the Seimas, these people agreed to join such an unexpected alliance. However, we should now clearly expect no less factional infighting than existed until recently in the Seiyukai."
 NW_JAP.336.a: "And Minseito is used to this kind of squabbling"
 NW_JAP.337.t: "Fighting for Deputies"
 NW_JAP.337.d: "From the beginning, Shakai Taishuto had a faction of deputies with social democratic views - they were the centrist and right-wing faction of the Social Democratic Movement. They were the ones most opposed to the party's merger with Tohokai and Ryutaro Nagai was aware of this. It is not surprising, therefore, that his work to create a new party could not but affect these people, many of whom he managed to lure into his movement, which finally had a name. The new party will be called the "New Frontier Party" (Shinshinto), similar to the Progressive Party, one of Rikken Minshito's longtime predecessors."
 NW_JAP.337.a: "We'll see if these actions are justified"
 NW_JAP.338.t: "Fusanosuke Kuhara's Association with the Conspirators."
 NW_JAP.338.d: "In the course of the investigation of the failed putsch, the most surprising fact was the cooperation of the heads of some zaibatsu with the conspiratorial young officers. They themselves justify their actions by a sense of self-preservation due to threats from radicals, since it was the representatives of big capital who were most antagonistic to the young officers as "the people who seized power in the country". Some still believe that using young officers as a tool, the representatives of the zaibatsu wished to carry out reforms in the country that were convenient for themselves and truly seize power.\n\nThe most surprising example of such a person was Fusanosuke Kuhara - one of the leaders of the largest parliamentary party Rikken Seiyukai, its general secretary. His direct participation in the failed coup attempt has not yet been proven, but his financing of the conspirators and their ideologist Ikki Kita has been established.The scandal led to Kuhara's resignation from the party, and he was taken into custody pending a judicial investigation."

 NW_JAP.339.t: "President Rikken Seiyukai's statement"
 NW_JAP.339.d: "Since 1935, one of the main parliamentary parties, the Rikken Seiyukai, has been in a state of permanent crisis. First, a group of deputies broke away from the party to form the Shōwakai Party in protest of the Seiyukai's policies toward the then cabinet, and the 1936 parliamentary elections dealt a fatal blow to the party's leader, Kisaburo Suzuki. The near defeat in the election and the victory of their main rivals, the Rikken Minseito, with small parties growing in the background destroyed Suzuki's reputation within the party, and also undermined his morale and later his physical condition. It was only through the efforts of his relative, Ichiro Hatoyama, that he managed to win a seat in the House of Peers and retain influence in the party for a while longer. However, amid his deteriorating health, Suzuki announced today that he will step down as party president at the end of his term (in two years), but in the meantime the party will have a four-man collective leadership system: Ichiro Hatoyama himself, Yonezo Maeda, Toshio Shimada and Chikuhei Nakajima. The latter three are representatives of the so-called "pro-war" Seiyukai faction, an influential group in the party that favors cooperation with the army top brass and support for the military's actions."

 NW_JAP.340.d: "Ichiro Hatoyama, one of the leaders of the Rikken Seiyukai Party, is asking for a review of the conviction of Fusanosuke Kuhara, a member of his party who financed the February conspirators. Hatoyama's proposal was supported by a large number of people with their signatures vouching for the former Seiyukai leader's innocence. So far, it is true that his direct involvement in the incident has never been established, but the fact that he was basically funding people like Ikki Kita raises big questions about his political views."

 NW_JAP.341.t: "Kuhara's Reinstatement in the Party"
 NW_JAP.341.d: "As expected, after the charges against Fusanosuke Kuhara were dropped, he was immediately reinstated to the Rikken Seiyukai through the mediation of Ichira Hatoyama. The latter's persistence in trying to bring a man linked to army conspirators back into the party is surprising, but it is rumored to be due to the increasing influence of the Chikuhei Nakajima faction in the Rikken Seiyukai. Nakajima, the owner of the largest zaibatsu that manufactures military and civilian airplanes, has been gradually seizing his power in the party by surrounding himself with people with so-called "pro-war views" in the Seiyukai. It is possible that a shared hatred for Nakajima's reinforcement allowed Hatoyama and Kuhara to overcome their difference of opinion, given the latter's political weight, connections, and influence."
 NW_JAP.341.a: "Seiyukai continues to storm"
 NW_JAP.342.t: "Rikken Seiyukai Innovation Alliance"
 NW_JAP.342.d: "The time is approaching when the ailing and aged Rikken Seiyukai President Kisaburo Suzuki will finally leave office, ending the party's temporary collective governance regime. However, the conflict between the two factions within it has not died down, but has only flared up with renewed vigor - the Innovation Alliance or Reform Alliance group within the party was formed today. It comes from the reformist faction of Chikuhei Nakajima and his various organizations: The National Policy Research Group and the National Institute for Economic Research, where scholars were invited to conduct research on the political and economic situation at home and abroad. He was the man who promoted and assisted the so-called "new bureaucrats", and he is also a proponent of an alliance with army officers. Apparently, Nakajima and his supporters are preparing to finally seize power in the party."

 NW_JAP.343.t: "Suzuki Appoints New Seiyukai Leadership"
 NW_JAP.343.d: "Tensions in the Rikken Seiyukai reached a fever pitch after the announcement of the Alliance for Reform. The "outburst" of discontent did not have to wait long. Today, the virtually powerless but formal president of the Rikken Seiyukai, Kizaburo Suzuki, announced that he was removing Chikuhei Nakajima, Yonezo Maeda, and Toshio Shimada from their positions as acting party president. In their place, Fusanosuke Kuhara, Tadaso Mito, and Kenkichi Yoshizawa take their places in the collective leadership. This was reportedly done at the prompting of Ichira Hatoyama, who thus responded to the formation of the Rikken Seiyukai Innovation Alliance. Mito and Yoshizawa are believed to be people from Hatoyama's faction. In addition, it should not be forgotten that in the coming months the period of collective leadership in the Seiyukai is expected to end with the election of a new president and such a castling dramatically strengthens the position of the "heir apparent"."
 NW_JAP.343.a: "Is it Hatoyama's victory?"
 NW_JAP.344.t: "Nakajima Becomes the New Seiyukai President"
 NW_JAP.344.d: "Tensions in the Rikken Seiyukai after the announcement of the Alliance for Reform reached a fever pitch. Various rumors and newspapers reported that because of such divisive behavior Hatoyama decided to take an important step - he turned to the still formally acting party president Kisabura Suzuki and asked him to change the collective presidents from among his opponents, even if it will be Fusanosuke Kuhara's people.\n\nApparently Nakajima, reasonably fearing that Hatoyama's mentor, Suzuki, would take this step, decided to "strike first" and today his faction, mostly members of the Alliance for Reform, gathered at an extraordinary party meeting, to which especially disloyal party members were pragmatically not invited, and proclaimed the end of the period of collective rule and the election of Nakajima as the new president of the Rikken Seiyukai. The meeting was given additional legitimacy by the presence of 3 of the 4 collective presidents, Toshio Shimada and Maeda Yoneza, who have long openly supported Nakajima on almost all issues. So far, the reaction of the remaining party is unknown, but it's worth assuming that they won't just swallow it."

 NW_JAP.346.d: "As promised, the elderly formal president of the Rikken Seiyukai, Kisaburo Suzuki, finally steps down, announcing the election of a new leader and thus ending the period of collective leadership of the party. During this time, two camps clearly emerged in the Seiyukai: the pro-war Nakajima faction and the faction of Hatoyama, Suzuki's successor, which managed to win the vote. With a sufficient margin, Ichiro Hatoyama now leads the country's oldest political party. It is said that Nakajima was extremely upset about this, but not feeling confident underneath himself, he did not dare to engage in divisive actions within the party. Especially since he had already formed a quite powerful, self-loyal Innovation Alliance group within the party a few months ago, without which Hatoyama's own legitimacy would be undermined. However, Hatoyama is rumored to be looking to further develop the party's image as a "pro-constitution" party, reaffirming its name and engaging in ideological confrontation with the more pro-war Rikken Minsaito."

During this time, the Seiyukai clearly formed two camps: the faction of Hatoyama, Hatoyama's successor, who tried to keep the party from indulging in the military, and the faction of Nakajima, his ideological rival, who managed to win the vote. With a sufficient margin, Chikuhei Nakajima now leads the country's oldest political party. As head of the zaibatsu, which produces aircraft, mostly military aircraft, he is actively involved with army and navy officers. Nakajima supports the expansionist aspirations of the army, but does not consider it necessary to eliminate the parliament, and offers them a convenient cooperation in his person. Hatoyama has been unable to reverse the trend within the party to support Nakajima; moreover, the latter has become an overly important financial backer of the party through his financial conglomerate."

 NW_JAP.348.d: "Nakajima's reaction was not to be expected for long, as he announced the withdrawal of his Innovation Alliance from the Rikken Seiyukai in protest. This will severely undermine the party's position in parliament, as over the years Nakajima has managed to build a large faction of loyalists around him. It is true that the Seiyukai is not accustomed to such withdrawals from the party - this is exactly what happened in 1935 with the Shōwakai party - a group of former Seiyukai members who were dissatisfied with the lack of support for the current cabinet from the party leadership. However, the current situation is very different from the Shōwakai in that the Seiyukai leaders will now have to think about finding new sources of funding, as Nakajima had previously provided most of the investment from the income of his zaibatsu."

 NW_JAP.349.t: "Hatoyama Elected President of the Rikken Seiyukai"
 NW_JAP.349.d: "After Nakajima's faction voluntarily withdrew from the Rikken Seiyukai, it was impossible to expect any other outcome to the election of the party president than the long-awaited victory of Ichira Hatoyama, as his faction became dominant. Fusanosuke Kuhara could have been a problem, but he failed to gather the necessary coalition around him, and Hatoyama made an important step that dramatically raised his position in the party - a proposal to change the collective leadership, which not only made Kuhara the interim president, but also Tadaso Mito and Kenkichi Yoshizawa. During the vote for party president, they thanked Hatoyama and the latter won the required number of votes."

 NW_JAP.350.d: "It did not take long for the rest of the Seiyukai Party to respond - Hatoyama and Kuhara quickly organized an alternative meeting to which they invited all remaining party members. At the meeting, they condemned the actions of the reformist faction and announced the expulsion of Nakajima, Shimada and Yonezo for violating the party charter and arbitrarily seizing power in the party. In their place, Tadaso Mito and Kenkichi Yoshizawa were appointed as acting presidents. The party leaders called their caucus the orthodox Rikken Seiyukai Party. Suzuki finally lost power and was left out, although it is worth noting that unlike the reformists immediately Hatoyama and Kuhara did not go to elect a new president. On the other hand, analysts speculate that this was due to their own ideological antagonism between each other and the "ad hoc alliance" assembled to oppose Nakajima."

 NW_JAP.351.d: "The collapse of the oldest parliamentary party, the Rikken Seiyukai, continues as the "neutral faction" headed by Tsuneo Kanemitsu, Masataka Ota, and Takeru Inukai announced today that it has split from the other two factions. The latter is the son of Tsuyoshi Inukai Tsuyoshi, prime minister of the Seiyukai Inukai, who was assassinated by the military in 1932, but despite this, Tsuneo Kanemitsu, a major bureaucrat and manager of several corporations, is the leader of this group. Their ideological views are rather close to Hatoyama's faction, but they do not support his tactical alliance with Kuhara, a man who has sullied his reputation as the "financial backer of the February 26 putschists". On the other hand, Ota and Inukai are acquaintances of Prince Fumimaro Konoe. But it's worth remembering that the entire "neutral faction" is much smaller than either of the other two Seiyukai factions, precluding the possibility of any strong influence on the political process. And yet, despite this, the main thing that unites the "neutrals" - is the desire to reunify the Rikken Seiyukai, as they told reporters at a press conference."

Despite his position as "Suzuki's heir", Hatoyama's faction was too small within the party. It was also partly influenced by the emergence of the Seiyukai "neutral faction", which Hatoyama is said to have counted on because of their similar ideological views. Other analysts say that Kuhara was chosen as a "mediator" between the two camps of Nakajima and Hatoyama, but it is likely to be of no avail and the party will not be reunited - its leaders are not going to back down."

This was especially unexpected against the backdrop of the well-known ideological confrontation between "tactical allies" Hatoyama and Kuhara - the latter turned out to be an even more pro-war and radical politician, thus confirming his financial assistance to the February 26 coup plotters. However, Hatoyama needs to proceed with caution, as Kuhara, with his connections, continues to be a dangerous rival."

Kuhara's expectations were fully confirmed - he envisages the Seiyukai being dissolved so that its example will be followed by other parliamentary parties, and to reaffirm national unity, he advocated a "National Council". Thus he too preaches the "one country, one party" theory. After the Rikken Seiyukai meeting, Kuhara convened a coalition of former members of both houses of parliament and leaders of all branches in Tokyo's Shiba Park and proposed the dissolution of the Rikken Seiyukai Party. Kuhara also met with Fumimaro Konoe and reported in the newspaper."

Apparently realizing that cooperating with Kuhara was a mistake, he decided to take this action. However, these futile attempts were a failure - Kuhara's influence and connections in the political world of Japan are so great that he managed to thwart Hatoyamu and Chuji's plan. Talk that very quickly after forming their alliance, Hatoyama and Kuhara realized that they could not work together has been going around for a long time. Perhaps to Hatoyama's surprise, his "anti-Nakajima ally" turned out to be an even more pro-war and radical politician than Nakajima himself."

It was only through the efforts of his relative, Ichiro Hatoyama, that he managed to win a seat in the House of Peers and retain influence in the party for a while longer. Today, however, amid his deteriorating health, Suzuki announced that he would step down as party president and that Hatoyama, his protégé and one of the party's top functionaries, would take his place. Despite his some of his actions in his early 30s, he is currently considered the leader of the party's "anti-war faction"."

 NW_JAP.357.t: "Intra-party Criticism of Hatoyama"
 NW_JAP.357.d: "After another failure of the Rikken Seiyukai in the parliamentary elections, the majority of the party has developed grievances against the party leadership, especially Hatoyama, who is now perceived as "the failed successor of the equally failed Suzuki" - their reputation ruined by successive failures in competition with other parties.In addition, they are also credited with the Shōwakai breakaway following the failed policy of opposing the cabinet.Hatoyama tried to fend off this criticism, realizing that behind it were his longtime rival Chikuhei Nakajima and his pro-war faction, as well as perhaps the army leaders themselves, who found in Nakajima a last chance to gain power by legal means."
 NW_JAP.357.a: "Hatoyama is really failing"
 NW_JAP.358.t: "Hatoyama Resigns"
 NW_JAP.358.d: "The storm of resentment against Hatoyama continued to grow as articles criticizing the Suzuki-Hatoyama leadership began to be published in party journals and newspapers. Soon enough, the party debate turned into a threat to withdraw the majority of party members if Hatoyama did not resign from his post. So far, however, there have been no statements from his side. Discussions began about the possible formation of a new party, but soon everything was resolved - Hatoyama called an extraordinary meeting of the party, where he announced his resignation and, accordingly, the election of the party president. They were held quickly and with an obvious outcome - the winner was Nakajima, who will obviously now begin the final restructuring of the party for himself and his pro-war faction."
 NW_JAP.358.a: "That's sad"
 NW_JAP.359.t: "Strengthening the pro-war agitation of Rikken Seiyukai"
 NW_JAP.359.d: "The Rikken Seiyukai Party, led by Chikuhei Nakajima, has decided to take the opposite stance against our party's claims of taking a strong anti-war stance, and to make the most of this issue. By promoting the old thesis about the independence of the Supreme Army Command, they are trying to win the trust of the voters and, most importantly, to gain support among the military to pressure us through them and other elite groups."
 NW_JAP.359.a: "Once again Nakajima has proven himself to be a puppet of the military"
 NW_JAP.360.t: "Kuhara's on Top"
 NW_JAP.360.d: "After much turmoil and what appeared to be the complete destruction of the Rikken Seiyukai Party, its leader, Fusanosuke Kuhara, who unexpectedly ascended to office, managed to lead it to victory, which confirmed his claim to the post. And while for party members this means a warm seat in the new cabinet, for the rest of us it means the restoration or rather the establishment of a pause, a silence. Silence before the thunder - because everyone has already heard about Kuhara's ties to the February 26 conspirators, and is also well aware, thanks to Kuhara himself, of his positions and the ideology that now dominates within the party."
 NW_JAP.360.a: "Will Kuhara dare to realize a one-party movement?"
 NW_JAP.361.t: "Rikken Seiyukai has Regained the Lead"
 NW_JAP.361.d: "After a long and unsuccessful period of Kisaburo-Hatoyama's rule, during which Rikken Seiyukai lost her position in parliament and was never able to lead the cabinet, she has now managed to do so under the leadership of Chikuhei Nakajima. This raises Nakajima's own reputation within the party to an even higher level, confirming that his faction has taken the ruling position for a reason. Along with this, however, come concerns due to the fact that the Seiyukai leader has long been known as a supporter of army officers and their ideologies."
 NW_JAP.361.a: "The Army men have again found an advocate for their interests"
 NW_JAP.362.t: "Seiyukai Dominates the Parliament"
 NW_JAP.362.d: "Ichiro Hatoyama has finally been able to prove that he is a good leader and not just a protege of the previous, unsuccessful Suzuki Party president. This victory in the parliamentary elections and the post of prime minister will fully enhance his reputation and allow him to realize the new political ideals he has developed over the past years in the course of intra-party confrontations."
 NW_JAP.362.a: "A stable Seiyukai is the key to the formation of a democratic system"
 NW_JAP.363.t: "Hatoyama Led the Rikken Seiyukai to Victory"
 NW_JAP.363.d: "Ichiro Hatoyama was able to unite at least the entire orthodox part of the Rikken Seiyukai Party under his control and lead it to victory in the parliamentary elections. This was an important goal for him, as it could help him against the now rival Reformist Seiyukai Party under the leadership of Chikuhei Nakajima, not a faction. In essence, this means that Hatoyama was right in the dispute between them, and now the number of questions for Nakajima, who destroyed the party, will increase dramatically."
 NW_JAP.363.a: "It is possible that this is the first step towards rebuilding the Seiyukai"
 NW_JAP.364.t: "Konoe Forms a Government"
 NW_JAP.364.d: "Prince Konoe's agreement to take over the Kakushin Shinto party was an unexpected decision on his part, as he had long refused to get involved in the political wrangling of the lower house of parliament because of his background and his seat in the House of Peers. However, having apparently realized the mood of the public and where the country was heading, the shrewd and sensitive Konoe decided to take this step in order to achieve his main goal of sitting in the prime minister's chair. Given his own ideological preferences, as well as those of his co-partisans, however, we should now expect a strong change in the political structure of the state."
 NW_JAP.364.a: "Seems like he's got it going on"
 NW_JAP.365.t: "Kakushin Shinto Forms a Government"
 NW_JAP.365.d: "Kakushin Shinto has proven to be much more resilient than initially thought. It has already survived many severe crises, but overall the idea of constant merger and cooperation of political parties in our country is still relevant - after all, its predecessor, Shakai Taishuto, was also a merger of several other parties initially. Now Kakushin Shinto has already won the election and will have to form a government."
 NW_JAP.365.a: "These mergers have proven to be extremely successful"
 NW_JAP.366.t: "Tohokai will have to Form a Government"
 NW_JAP.366.d: "The elections for the House of Representatives have been successfully concluded and unlike some previous ones without major bloody upheavals in Tokyo. The results are being circulated by the newspapers today, with Seigo Nakano's Tohokai Party unexpectedly winning. It's hard to say whose credit it is more - his or his opponents, who were too ill-prepared for this election."

 NW_JAP.367.d: "After much party turbulence and inter-factional fighting, the National Socialist faction managed to impose its ideology on the rest of the party and together with it win the trust of the voters.

 NW_JAP.369.d: "Rikken Minseito continues to be the unsinkable ship of Japan's political world. It wins the next general election to the Diet, keeping party leader Machida Chuji in a position to form a government. To some extent, such successes contradict its ideology, as it assumes the formation of a stable two-party system, which has not yet been observed. However, it does open the door for the party to pursue various liberal reforms that were out of the question in previous years."

 NW_JAP.370.d: "Tanaka Chigaku, founder of the Kokuchukai organization, chief preacher of Nitiren Buddhism and creator of the ideology of Nitirenism, passed away today at the age of 78. Having become interested in religion at the end of the 19th century, he quickly became disillusioned with its overly "peaceful" forms and decided to develop his own doctrine, which eventually turned into Nichirenism, a fusion of the nationalist doctrine of Kokuchukai and Buddhism. His ideas were followed by such famous people as Nisho Inoue and Kanji Ishiwara, and even Ikki Kita came under his influence. Supporters of Nichirenism at the moment are already tens of thousands of people throughout Asia. His son, Satomi Kishio, will take over the leadership of Kokuchukai."

 NW_JAP.372.d: "After the death of General Secretary Shakai Taishuto Hisashi Aso, who also headed the National Socialist faction of the party, the latter began to lose strength. Inejiro Asanuma, who was close to him, was so shattered by the grief of the early loss of his comrade that he became depressed and rarely appeared at party meetings. Kenichiro Kamei, left virtually alone, was unable to fully replace them both. As a result, Abe Isu's Social Democratic faction managed to regain influence in the party and their ideology now dominates."

 NW_JAP.373.d: "Prince Konoe had recently secured amnesty for those involved in the Blood League incident, including their leader, Nisho Inoue, a Nithirenist. There had been rumors as to why he did this and why he would stand up for them at all, but the answer was recently revealed that because of his plans for the New System Movement, Konoe had become fearful of a possible assassination attempt by the military, as Konoe's entourage and himself had now realized that powerful military leaders were the main threat to Japan and its future, their unchecked actions in China and other war zones making the civilian government a scapegoat every time.  To prevent this, he has decided to hire as his bodyguards people who would clearly hate those who would try to assassinate the prince - they are old ideological opponents of the currently dominant top army officers. Besides - they are just very good marksmen, since they managed to kill several people during their political terrorist attack."
 NW_JAP.373.a: "Is the situation so desperate that he has to take them as his guards?"
 NW_JAP.374.t: "A Failed Assassination Attempt on the Prime Minister"
 NW_JAP.374.d: "In Tokyo today, police arrested 38 men among the conspirators who intended to assassinate the Prime Minister and possibly some other officials. They are members of the so-called "god-sent troops," or more specifically, Colonel Kingoro Hashimoto's Japan Youth Party. This formidable organization, rumored to number as many as 100 000 ardent soldiers, was almost like the Colonel's personal army. Its flag, a white sun against a red balloon, symbolized "bloody patriotism under a red-hot sun." Her commander boasted, "Look at me - I'm not a man who can sit back and talk." However, for the past few months, Kingoro Hashimoto seemed to have disappeared from public life, but in fact he has been weaving a web of conspiracy against the current cabinet like a spider. He trusted the idea of Prince Fumimaro Konoe and was one of the most zealous agitators for the dissolution of the old political parties. Apparently, this moral pressure on the prime minister to give up his post to Konoe was the main purpose of Hashimoto's plot. By arresting not only the rank-and-file members of the conspiracy, but also the Colonel himself, we will finally be able to deal with the New System Movement, which has been testing our government in recent months."

 NW_JAP.375.d: "A terrible event happened this morning - Shakai Taishuto party leader Abe Isa was attacked. He is currently living with his wife in the Dojunkai Apartments in Tokyo, modern reinforced concrete buildings built after the Great Earthquake of 1923 for the victims and the needy, and a group of several men came in and rang the doorbell, and when Abe opened it, they hit him between the eyes with a cane with such force that the elderly politician fell to the floor. His wife, hearing something incomprehensible, immediately rushed into the corridor, from where the criminals had already left. Although the injury was not serious, Abe was lucky that his daughter and her husband, physician Tisato Maruyama, live in the same building.\n\nIn response to the attack on their leader, an emergency delegate meeting was held at the Socialist Mass Party headquarters, where it was decided that each faction would be called upon to submit "a resolution of censure regarding the maintenance of public order in the imperial capital". In addition, an opinion calling for the dismissal of Interior Minister Nobumasa Suetsugu was also expressed. Shakai Taishuto MP Jotaro Kawakami has already raised an urgent question in the House plenary and held the minister responsible. Suetsugu responded, "We will take decisive action.

His security was beefed up and it is possible that the assassination attempt was thus prevented. In the meantime, the investigation department was able to identify the assailants from a cane bought at a store in Tokyo. It was a group of juvenile ultranationalists who acted on the orders of their leader Toichi Mannen - they turned him in without delay during interrogation.\n\nThe investigation revealed that the reason for their attack was that the leaders of Shakai Taishuto had not abandoned their ideas of establishing socialism in the country at such a crucial historical moment, but on the contrary, they wanted to take advantage of the situation to advance their goal."

 NW_JAP.378.t: "Debate Around the New System"
 NW_JAP.378.d: "The Meiji Constitution contains no legal provisions regarding the procedure for appointing the prime minister. Officially, the emperor, who was the "general ruler of the government", was to exercise the right of appointment at will, unconstrained by legal provisions or the wishes of his subjects. However, if the Prime Minister made a mistake, the Emperor would be responsible for the appointment, and while this was to be avoided, it was also necessary to maintain the format in which the Emperor personally appointed the Prime Minister. After much trial and error during the Meiji period, this issue was resolved by having the emperor's nine unofficial advisors, the genro, advise him on who to appoint as head of the cabinet, and the monarch "accepts" their nomination.However, this solution could not be permanent due to the natural aging and death of the advisors. By the end of the Taisho period, only the great Kimmochi Saionji was alive. From this period onward, the emperors raised the question of a new procedure for appointing the prime minister. Now the time has come for the urgent need to choose one. Among the options under consideration, offered by various of the emperor's inner circle, are the following:\n\n1. Consultation with the Privy Council;\n2. Consultation with senior ministers;\n3.\n\nThe first involves strengthening the powers of the Privy Council, an institutional law-making body under the emperor that advises him on various matters of state. The second involves replacing the genro with a group of people with experience in public service in various government positions, such as former prime ministers. The third, however, proposes a mixture of consultations with the Privy Council and former prime ministers - it is promoted by Koichi Kido, Konoe's closest aide and, like him, a representative of a group of "young aristocrats"."

Here he composed a sharp written indictment of the conduct of the Imperial Japanese Army in China. In it he described the terrible atrocities committed by the Japanese against both civilians and prisoners of war. As an example, he cited an incident that shocked him when an officer told him that the best way to train recruits was to use live Chinese POWs for bayonet practice "because it gives you willpower". He also said that he had been shown army films showing Japanese soldiers gassing Chinese prisoners tied to stakes and attaching bacteriological bombs to planes preparing to bomb Chinese cities. The movie was shown to him personally by General Shiro Ishii, head of Unit 731, based in Manchuria and engaged in the development of such weapons."

It is the first joint German-Japanese film project and was produced at the suggestion of the Ministry of Culture of the Empire of Japan.\n\nThe movie tells the story of a successful young man, Yamato Teruo, who returns to Japan after six years of studying at an agricultural college in Germany. Teruo is an adopted son in an old samurai family and is expected to marry Mitsuko, the eldest daughter. However, Teruo has become infected with the idea of Western individualism during his time in Western Europe and refuses to submit to the demands of society. Instead, he confuses his future father-in-law, Yamato Iwao, by announcing that he intends to marry Gerda Storm, a German journalist he met on a ship returning to Japan. Gerda, however, is a blonde, chaste, Aryan woman, and she will not settle for a mixed-race relationship. She tries to convince him of his duty to the Japanese race and traditions and reconcile him with his family. Meanwhile, Mitsuko, feeling humiliated by Teruo's rejection, attempts suicide by throwing herself into a volcano. At the last second, she is rescued by Teruo, and the couple are romantically reunited.At the last second, she is rescued by Teruo, and the couple is romantically reunited. A short while later, the young couple and their child now live in Manchukuo-Go, "New Earth", working on a farm under the benevolent gaze of a vigilant soldier protecting them from the omnipresent threat of Bolshevism.\n\nThe film brought together an all-star cast of Japanese cinema: Mitsuko is played by the young diva Setsuko Hara, and she would travel to Germany on a tour to premiere the film. The film had two directors, Arnold Funk and Mansaku Itami, which eventually led to two versions of the film, each for its own country. Critics received the movie poorly in our country - they saw it as a condescending treatment of Japan as an exotic eastern nation that needs German political ideas as if it had none of its own. Also, many critics noted the racist ideology of "Blood and Soil", which they found disturbing. However, everyone appreciated Setsuko Hara's performance - she has now gained national and possibly worldwide fame."

Recalling Hitler's claim that Germany's defeat in the Great War was due to Jewish domination of finance and administration in collusion with the bureaucracy, he drew an analogy to the control of Japan's wartime economy by bureaucrats and their capitalist accomplices in state-supported economic agencies. It was the people, he insisted, who really had the "Jewish mentality", not the people sometimes accused by the new bureaucrats, the independently thinking industrialists, who resisted the dead hand of bureaucratic control and were the ones who were really capable of effectively managing Japan's crisis economy."

However, Nakano himself used it sometimes almost as a pejorative, for example, when responding to an accusation of "fascism", he claimed that it was in fact the "new bureaucrats'" who had actually led the country into "professional bureaucratic fascism".

After an hour-long interview, Mussolini authorized Nakano to convey his willingness to enter into a comprehensive alliance with Japan and asked him to record an address to Japanese youth that read, "March straight ahead - straight ahead! If you encounter obstacles, keep marching straight ahead!" Nakano used this phrase as the title of his article about the trip."

 NW_JAP_news.55.t: "[GetNewsHeadline] Seigo Nakano in Berlin"
 NW_JAP_news.55.d: "Through the mediation of the strongly pro-German Japanese military attaché Oshima, the leader of the Japanese fascist movement, Seigo Nakano, managed to meet with Foreign Minister Baron Neurath and other leading Nazis and finally with Hitler himself. Here too, the Japanese Embassy tried to limit the time of the interview, but Hitler extended it to 50 minutes. During their conversation, Hitler denied any territorial claims in East Asia, hoping only for trade opportunities, the main obstacle to which was the Comintern. He hoped Japan would solve the problem, but hoped the war would not be too debilitating. To this, Nakano assured him that the real battle was already over. The Kuomintang was now just a regional force. Nakano later described Hitler as much more cautious and deliberative in his discussions than Mussolini, who always had ready answers."
 NW_JAP_news.55.a: "Honest conversation"
 NW_JAP.393.t: "Trip Results"
 NW_JAP.393.d: "Returning to Japan, after personally reporting to Prince Konoe, who had given him a secret letter to the Axis leaders before his trip, Nakano addressed Army and Navy staff meetings at which he not only advocated a military alliance with the Axis, but insisted on the capture of Canton as a last resort to isolate the Kuomintang in order to challenge Britain. Kanji Ishiwara, who attended the meetings, lamented the callousness of the staff officers who quietly listened as Nakano "shamelessly expounded his amateurish strategy". It's worth remembering that Ishiwara was the center of resistance to launching a full-scale war with China in the army. And apparently despite their earlier close relationship (Ishiwara was Nakano's military advisor), they are now distancing themselves from each other."
 NW_JAP.393.a: "Surely the idea of an alliance with Germany must have greatly pleased other army officers"
 NW_JAP.394.t: "Nakano in the spotlight"
 NW_JAP.394.d: "Seigo Nakano's visit to the European fascist powers was accompanied by a major media campaign. A handout prepared by his diplomatic advisor Nakayama Masaru for distribution during his visit described Nakano as the central figure of the "renewal movement", Japan's greatest orator, a true Japanese in his faults and virtues, an economist of the Friedrich List school (whom he had studied at Waseda University and sometimes quoted, though not as a central authority), and a Confucian idealist, strengthened by personal tragedy and now living "the stoic life of a Zen monk".\n\nThe image he himself tried to project was definitely reminiscent of his assessment of Hitler, whom he described as a mere "patriot" from the lower strata of German society, whom he was for that reason "honored to represent". Similarly, "it is to our Tohokai that the privilege of leading our society has been entrusted". He regarded Hitler's loyalty as demonstrated by his celibacy and vegetarianism, just as Mussolini abstained from alcohol and tobacco."
 NW_JAP.394.a: "I visited European countries. The leaders there - well, literally me"
 NW_JAP.395.t: "Eastern Youth Corps"
 NW_JAP.395.d: "Upon his return from Europe, he focused on building a mass movement modeled on the Nazi Party as he envisioned it, based on a youth movement called the Eastern Youth Corps from late 1938 onwards. Its members wore a uniform consisting of a black field cap, a dark blue shirt, a dark red tie, and an armband depicting a swastika based on the initial character "Tohokai", meaning "East".\n\nNakano's own appearance changed so noticeably that an old friend of Ogata's commented, "His black fascist uniform, the emblem resembling a Nazi swastika on his armband, and his trips to Europe all make me think he's lost his mind". Despite these and other derisive comments, Nakano continued to wear the uniform and participate in rallies across the country."

From now on, the law gives the government full power to control people's daily lives and general business activities. Under the law, the Sejm will be effectively stripped of its functions.Small parties and some independent MPs actively supported the bill. The two dominant groups of lawmakers on whom the fate of the law depended, Rikken Minseito and Rikken Seiyukai, initially voiced strong opposition to the bill, saying it violated the Constitution. But in the end, after much negotiation, they too supported the bill."

 NW_JAP.396.t: "Agrarian expansionism in Manchuria"
 NW_JAP.396.d: "The main ideologue of "agrarian expansionism" was Kato Kanji, an educator and agriculturist who has been running his own agricultural school for farmers and possible settlers in Manchuria for several years. He has his own coherent belief system, which assumes that the farmers will cultivate the land they receive on their own, thus returning to the "original Yamato spirit", purge internal moral issues, and become a solid support for the imperial throne. In addition, he suggests that they will abandon modern capitalist mechanization of labor and return to manual farming. Also, Kato believes that this is where the true spirit of "soldier-farmers" will be realized, as he believes that settlers should be armed with light small arms and be ready to defend their newly acquired land.\n\nHe is also assisted in this by Colonel Togu Tetsuo of the Kwantung Army, who is also interested in colonizing Manchuria, as this will make it easier to control all of Manchukuo-Go's lands and will be a powerful weapon in the future war with the Soviet Union - for this purpose the settlers are given plots of land along the border with the USSR. Togu suggests that when the war begins, Japanese farmers will be able to help the Kwantung Army with food supplies and fight guerrillas infiltrating across the border. It is worth noting, however, that Kato did not envision his settlers cooperating with the Kwantung Army, but in the end did not refuse the colonel's help."
 NW_JAP.396.a: "Interesting concepts"
 NW_JAP.397.t: "Kato's dissatisfaction with the colonization of Manchuria"
 NW_JAP.397.d: "Kato and his supporters were disappointed when the settlers in Manchuria turned out to be landowners rather than altruistic farmers and preferred modern farming methods. Instead of improving national fortunes and morals, they sought security and a comfortable life. This included hiring Chinese as laborers on their land holdings. This reality led Kato to cut back on recruiting adult settlers and instead focus on adolescents, who would presumably be young people with high goals. To this end, he convinced the Ministry of Agriculture to create a Youth Volunteer Corps for Manchurian development and personally train them in "Yamatobataraki" ("working for the Yamato")."
 NW_JAP.397.a: "On the other hand, the army is interested in recruiting young men into its ranks"
 NW_JAP.398.t: "Anti-Bolshevik Bloc Proposal"
 NW_JAP.398.d: "Through secret channels, the government of the Empire of Japan proposed to us the idea of an alliance against the Soviet Union in order to overthrow the Bolshevik power in that country. Long ago we promised this to the White forces during the Russian Civil War, but at that time it seemed to us that the Bolshevik power could not last five years without invasion, but now we can clearly say that totalitarian regimes are much more dangerous than we thought in the early 20s. In any case, since we do not have a border with the USSR, Japan will take the main blow, and we will only support it in this confrontation at sea, in the air and with arms, and most importantly - it will distract Japan for a long time from attempts to seize our Asian possessions."

 NW_JAP.400.d: "The French representatives have rejected the idea we have proposed. They do not want to take part in any wars in the near future, especially in such distant frontiers. Apparently, their hatred of the Communists is a farce, and their promises to the Whites during the Russian Civil War were indeed a deception."
 NW_JAP.400.a: "We'll find other allies"
 NW_JAP.401.t: "Turanist Union"
 NW_JAP.401.d: "The Japanese government in recent years has taken the concept of the Turanian origin of the Japanese people seriously and has decided to adopt it as a fundamental part of its policy. It thus reinforces the long-standing aspirations of the Japanese for Siberia and the liberation of these lands from the Bolsheviks and Russians. In line with this, they also wish to expand ties with us, and several other countries on the border with the USSR, as parts of the larger Turanian world. The final goal of this rapprochement should be a common alliance against the USSR for the liberation of the Turanian peoples from the clutches of Bolshevism and the Slavs."

At the outset of the talks, he indicated that he believed the incident could be resolved peacefully. The Japanese promised not to attack Peking and Tianjin under the following conditions:\n\n1. The Kuomintang must expel all anti-Japanese organizations from the cities and stop anti-Japanese demonstrations;\n2. The Kuomintang should take full responsibility for the July 7 incident;\n3. Song Zheyuan, not any lower-ranking officer, should personally apologize for the incident.\n\nIn addition, Japanese representatives told Zheng that they would prefer to see him as the head of the Beijing and Hebei Chahar Council.

Only a few dozen soldiers and 60 civilians of the city who were living there in our concession managed to escape from Tongzhou.

On the other hand, many analysts and experts on Japan believe that the emperor could not have done so, so it is difficult to blame him for starting the war. Moreover, there are fears that abandoning the monarchy would turn the vast majority of the country's population against us and threaten to start a civil war, since the Japanese are very loyal to their emperor and the dynasty that has ruled the country for more than 2000 years.\n\nWe should also consider a constitution proposed by the Japanese politicians themselves from the current government. These politicians are trustworthy, as they ruled the country during the Taisho democracy, but their draft of the main document of the country is almost a complete copy of the old Meiji constitution with some cosmetic changes and lack of such a strong influence of the military."

 NW_JAP_news.59.d: "After the Empire of Japan was occupied, the new authorities tried to organize the country's administration through the former authorities - the old bureaucratic apparatus of the monarchy. Today, however, it was announced that Japan would cease to be a monarchy and that the Emperor would abdicate. Many immediately suggested that the dangerous decision of the victorious power, as the two-thousand-year history of the Japanese monarchy will not be able to end so easily - after that, we can immediately expect unrest fraught with full-fledged uprisings."

Even experts on our country persuaded them to abandon this decision or to take a compromise option - to force the current emperor to abdicate in favor of his heir.\n\nNow the situation is getting worse and worse every day - discontent is growing in the countryside, spontaneous rallies are taking place in the cities, which the occupation forces are trying to disperse.

 NW_JAP.435.d: "Japan's new constitution, drafted by the very best [ROOT.GetAdjective] and [FROM.GetAdjective] lawyers, was recently adopted. It declares the country to be a constitutional monarchy, with all executive power in the hands of a prime minister elected by the parliament. Parliament becomes bicameral, but the upper house now includes "counselors" rather than aristocrats. The monarch retains purely ceremonial powers, moreover, he can no longer even make political statements, so as not to provoke anything more like the political conspiracies of the 30s.\n\nAlso today, under the new constitution, the first elections for the National Parliament were held. They were won by the Liberal Party, whose leader Ichiro Hatoyama will become the new Prime Minister. The Progressive Party will also join the parliamentary coalition."

It was of such high quality and took into account the mistakes of the previous state system that the occupation authorities agreed to adopt it. With this, Shidehara was able to earn a lot of political respect, thanks to which he retained his position as head of the cabinet - in parliament he will be supported by the Liberal and Progressive parties. After the end of the transition period, the first free elections to the National Parliament under the new laws will be held, which will select a new prime minister who now has full executive power. The Monarch retains ceremonial constitutional powers."

So he decided himself after the advice of his entourage to show all his subjects that the era is changing - every emperor of Japan at the beginning of his reign announces the name of the new era, which he comes up with himself. The new monarch is the young Akihito, the son of Emperor Hirohito. Nobuhito, Prince Takamatsu, will remain as regent. The outgoing emperor is given a new special title, "Emperor in Retirement"."

 NW_JAP.444.t: "Four Handshakes"
 NW_JAP.444.d: "Count Richard Coudenhove-Kalergi is one of the main ideologists of the Pan-European Union in the world, but few people know that he was born into a mixed family of the Austro-Hungarian chargé d'affaires in Japan, Heinrich von Coudenhove-Kalergi, and a Japanese woman, Mitsuko Aoyama, the daughter of a large merchant. It is possible that it was this connection with Japan that saved the life of the young contemporary philosopher. Since the late 1920s, Kalergi had been in conflict with the NSDAP and Adolf Hitler in absentia, and after their rise to power, this became a direct threat to his life. In 1938 he published his last book, The Totalitarian State Against Man, after which he had to change country after country, hiding from persecution. Eventually, he was able to find asylum in Lisbon and then leave for the United States thanks to the Japanese ambassador, with whom he developed a good relationship. As a parting gift, the Count left the Ambassador a signed copy of this book. The ambassador, in turn, lent the book to the international journalist Shigeharu Matsumoto, who in turn lent it to the political scientist Asaso Ichimura of Waseda University. As a person close to Ichira Hatoyama, he gave the book to the prime minister, asking him to translate it into Japanese for wide distribution. Hatoyama was so taken by the ideas described in the book that he inquired about his fate and decided to establish a "Yuai" or "Brotherhood" in the country."
 NW_JAP.444.a: "Who's Yuai?"
 NW_JAP.445.t: "Brotherhood"
 NW_JAP.445.d: "The goal of the "Brotherhood" ("Yuai"), based on the Kudenhove-Kalergi philosophy, is to create a kinder world through motherly love. This theory includes mutual respect, mutual understanding, mutual aid, humanism, individualism, cooperation, chivalry, bushido, and building human relationships as if everyone is "ladies and gentlemen". The three principles of brotherhood are the philosophy of the fraternal movement: mutual respect, mutual understanding, and mutual aid (or mutual cooperation) based on the dignity of individuality. In addition, Hatoyama is known to have recently joined a Masonic lodge in Tokyo.\n\nThe move to create the Yuai suggests that Hatoyama not only liked the European philosopher's ideas, but also the prime minister's personal problems. In the early 1930s, as a cabinet member and protégé of Kisaburo Suzuki, he dealt a severe blow to the reputation of democratic parties and the idea of party cabinets, which indirectly helped the military to disintegrate for a time and nearly seize power in the country. Hatoyama was also directly to blame for the curtailment of academic freedom of speech when he forced the dismissal of a left-wing professor from Kyoto Imperial University in 1933.  Soon enough he realized what all these actions had brought the country to, and from that point on he began trying to repair the political system from the wounds he himself had had a hand in.\n\nThis was the task that drove Hatoyama all along - atoning for his own sin and restoring his reputation. It was for this reason that Kudenhove-Kalergi's book struck at the Prime Minister's heart and won his trust. And today he seems to be able to relax - he has succeeded in fulfilling the goal he set for himself."

 NW_JAP.446.d: "We need to make a decision about the abolition of the Japanese monarchy. On the one hand, members of the imperial house have been tainted by their involvement in war crimes, and the monarch himself did not stop his subordinates when necessary. On the other hand, many analysts and experts on Japan are of the opinion that the emperor could not have done this, so it is difficult to blame him for starting the war. Moreover, there are fears that abandoning the monarchy will turn the vast majority of the country's population against us and create a threat of civil war, as the Japanese are very loyal to their emperor and the dynasty that has ruled the country for more than 2000 years."

For this reason, perhaps we should try them all and execute them, so that the various conspirators don't even have the desire to try to restore the monarchy.

Apparently, they had fled to Japanese-controlled territories because they were afraid of a possible trial because of their defection to the Japanese.

However, a miracle, or at least the hope for one, occurred: diplomats from both countries managed to negotiate a temporary agreement between the United States and Japan, returning relations between them to their pre-occupation status in Indochina, and the Japanese army would also return to its permitted borders in the northern part of the region.

 NW_JAP.473.d: "When Ayukawa's plan for Manchukuo's industrial development was just getting underway, rumors circulated that Matsuoka's resignation was inevitable. However, Matsuoka proved far more resilient. He stayed on longer than anyone expected, overseeing the reorganization of his research division and pushing for his vice president, Omura Takuichi, to become president. Only today did he tender his resignation. Newspapers reported the change in leadership at the South Manchuria Railway, but treated it casually. This was a stark contrast to the time of his appointment, when it was considered headline news. These days, neither Matsuoka nor Mantetsu deserved front-page coverage. Times have changed.\n\nThe years spent at SMR were good and memorable because Matsuoka's presidency allowed him to maintain the illusion of limitless possibilities. When the Industrial Division of the South Manchuria Railway was transferred to the newly established Mangyo, Matsuoka decided to create a new Research Division.His frantic activity - creating and implementing one new project after another in Mantetsu - concealed doubts about his own abilities and direction for the future.\n\nEven this ended with his resignation. Upon returning to Tokyo, he suddenly realized that he no longer had a position. A feeling of complete loneliness and powerlessness arose. He was still ambitious, but all paths to power were closed to him. The Mantetsu Research Department continued to supply him with intelligence reports, but they were not encouraging. His chances of becoming the next prime minister are considered zero, and his chances of becoming foreign minister are very slim. He had made too many political enemies for himself, and times had changed in ways no one could have imagined."
 NW_JAP.473.a: "But everyone now needs to remember that Matsuoka is back in the game"
 
 NW_JAP.474.t: "Re-establishment of the Matsuoka Youth Organization"
 NW_JAP.474.d: "After his triumphant return from Geneva, where he led the Japanese delegation out of a League of Nations meeting that was discussing the seizure of Manchuria, Matsuoka began to think about translating the accumulated trust and popularity among the masses into political influence. Then he also left parliament, surrendering his parliamentary mandate, calling for the dissolution of all political parties. He also created his own Youth Corps, numbering tens of thousands of people throughout the country. He began touring the country giving speeches and appearances, and was secretly supported by major financial players, as well as some of the publishers of major newspapers, however, without waiting for the post of prime minister to be handed over to him and without daring to take decisive action in the spirit of Benito Mussolini, whom he looked up to, Matsuoka agreed to take over the post of President Mantetsu in mid-1935, dissolving his organizations and movements.\n\nHowever, having lost on the battlefields of Manchuria, he recently returned to Tokyo and recently called on Ota Koichi to revive the youth organization he had created during the movement to disband the political party. As before, these young people were asked to prepare to serve the country during the national emergency and attend special training sessions and lectures. They were promised 20,000 yen per month to hire lecturers and organize educational meetings for these young people. The youth organization alone could not ensure Matsuoka's transition to a new political position, as had already been proven once in 1935. However, this gave him a certain degree of independence in negotiations with other politicians and military personnel.Some members of the youth groups, mostly from the lower middle and lower classes and predominantly from rural areas, were associated with right-wing groups.These were the same groups from which mid-level officers received support. Matsuoka also maintained close contacts with people like Toyama Mitsuru, the leader of the all-powerful Amur River Society, to secure recognition for right-wing groups."

 NW_JAP.475.t: "Matsuoka's daughter's wedding"
 NW_JAP.475.d: "Former diplomat Yosuke Matsuoka's daughter Kaneko married Tajima Joji. This is a traditional arranged marriage, in simple terms. The couple was allowed only three dates, after which Dzedzi had to give a definite answer about his intentions. Matsuoka was looking for a man in his future son-in-law who would not disappear at home like himself, and Joji was exactly the kind of man he imagined for his daughter. Jedzi is a graduate student at the University of Tokyo in French literature and has no interest in politics..\n\n The connection between this unremarkable everyday event and big politics lies in the fact that Matsuoka, after leaving the League of Nations, gained enormous popularity among the people, but lost any reputation among the highest ruling circles, which is a critical thing if a person wants to take the post of prime minister. His connections with young and mid-level officers added fuel to the fire. Every time he was mentioned in the context of politics, everyone recalled his support for an alliance with Germany and similar radical ideas.\n\nThanks to this marriage, this problem was resolved. The groom's family is highly respected in business and court circles. Whether intentional or not, Matsuoka's daughter's wedding helped him regain the favor of his peers."

In recent times, he has been able to restore his reputation in high political circles, and his diplomatic skills, despite the situation with the League of Nations, are well known. In addition, Matsuoka grew up in the United States, which in the current political climate looks like an ace up one's sleeve since it will allow Matsuoka to speak with many foreigners «in the same language» in every sense. Matsuoka himself has been searching for a long time for an opportunity to take the post of Minister of Foreign Affairs, which is what he has been focusing all his activities on in recent months.."

 NW_JAP.478.t: "Matsuoka disease"
 NW_JAP.478.d: "The other day, Dr. Terao Denji, the personal physician of Foreign Minister Matsuoka, came to examine him and was alarmed by the minister's condition. Matsuoka often coughed and tired quickly. He noted a clear deterioration in his health. At the same time, he already suffered from asthma and stomach ulcers. Matsuoka was prescribed rest, but it is a luxury he cannot afford.\n\nHe probably could have delegated some of his tasks to subordinates, but combined with the need to maintain secrecy, the "lone ranger" always felt that he could do his job much better than his subordinates. Thus, anything that Matsuoka himself cannot do is often ignored. His health and his lone ranger style became constant challenges in the conduct of foreign affairs. Dr. Terao prescribed bed rest, expecting his instructions to be strictly followed, but perhaps the fate of the country is at stake now and Matsuoka has only one chance to turn things around."

 NW_JAP.479.t: "Hospitalization of the Minister of Foreign Affairs"
 NW_JAP.479.d: "Foreign Minister Matsuoka was urgently hospitalized in Tokyo's best hospital due to his critical health condition - the day before he began to choke and lose consciousness. As is known, he had been having problems with both his lungs and stomach for a long time, but despite the recommendations of his personal doctor, Matsuoka continued to lead an active lifestyle, not paying attention to how his physical condition was deteriorating. According to him, in such a difficult time for the country, while it is still one step away from disaster, he could not sit idly by. However, now he will definitely not be able to perform his duties, and in the worst case, he may not return from the hospital due to his serious condition.."
 NW_JAP.479.a: "He gave his all to the country"
 
 NW_JAP.480.t: "Cyclone Matsuoki"
 NW_JAP.480.d: "Today, Foreign Minister Matsuoka ordered six ambassadors, eighteen consuls, ten consuls general, and six embassy counselors to return home. This major reshuffle of diplomatic personnel, involving forty senior diplomats, was unprecedented. Many believe this is an attempt by Matsuoka to weed out those who do not support his views on foreign policy, but some say there is a more complex nature to these actions. The press has already nicknamed it "Cyclone Matsuoka".\n\nCyclone Matsuoka has different meanings for different people who were affected by it. Matsuoka jokingly told his physician, Dr. Terao Denji, that he was trying to remove from office those ambassadors who had foreign wives. However, the only such diplomat was Ambassador Chibo, whose wife was German. The minister's personal secretary, Hasegawa Shinichi, whose home was close to Matsuoka's in Sendagai and who often traveled home with him by car, believes that Matsuoka is seeking personnel changes to create a new and inspiring atmosphere within the ministry."
 NW_JAP.480.a: "And yet, perhaps this is connected with the direction of his policy?"
 
 NW_JAP.481.t: "Pro-Japanese ambassadors"
 NW_JAP.481.d: "Matsuoka essentially ridiculed the idea that diplomats are labeled as either pro-American, pro-German, or anything else. The diplomat being recalled, traditionally considered “pro-American,” was sent to commit some act of a clearly anti-American nature along the way—and this was done with most ambassadors and consuls. In his opinion, they are all dependent on the countries in which they were located and, accordingly, represented their interests. He also wanted to invite Japanese diplomats who would best represent Japan's national interests.\n\nMatsuoka was constantly seen writing down many names of countries and countries in his notebook these days. This confirms that Matsuoka "acted alone" in personnel matters. This led to Matsuoka successfully transforming the Kasumigaseki bureaucracy into one that was more supportive of his leadership."
 NW_JAP.481.a: "This is a smart idea"
 
 NW_JAP.482.t: "Two important ambassadors"
 NW_JAP.482.d: "Ambassadors to the USA and the USSR were also changed. The army was pleased with the manner in which General Tatekawa was appointed to the ambassadorial post in Moscow in consultation with it - consultations were held with key officials in the army structure. Some time later, Matsuoka offered the post of ambassador to Washington to Admiral Nomura Kichisaburo. The navy was also pacified."

 NW_JAP.483.t: "Japanese Foreign Minister's Proposal"
 NW_JAP.483.desc: "Japanese Foreign Minister Yōsuke Matsuoka invited our ambassador to Tokyo for tea and cautiously raised the subject of a possible alliance. He asked about Germany's attitude to Japan's advance in the South Pacific and how Germany viewed Japan's relations with the Soviet Union. Matsuoka's ultimate idea was for India, the Dutch East Indies, and French Indochina to gain independence after Germany defeated their colonial masters. Matsuoka's even more ambitious plan assumed that all the peoples east of the Suez Canal should be liberated after the war, and Germany should look for its market in Africa. Matsuoka added that Germany would, of course, gain access to the natural resources of Southeast Asia and remote regions, but our ambassador immediately pointed out that Matsuoka's plan would require significant sacrifices from Germany. In the end, Matsuoka repeated the question about the possible conclusion of an alliance between the two countries, to which the ambassador replied evasively."

It is the threat posed by the Soviet Union that we should focus on, as the Bolsheviks will always destabilize the situation in Eurasia, according to Matsuoka. Apparently, Japan is afraid of war with the United States, and our ambassador in Tokyo says that the Japanese minister himself is more pro–American, which is not surprising, because Matsuoka grew up in the United States of America."

Максимальная идея Мацуоки заключалась в том, чтобы Индия, голландская Ост-Индия и французский Индокитай получат независимость после того, как Германия победит их колониальных хозяев. Ещё более грандиозный план Мацуоки предполагал, что все народы к востоку от Суэцкого канала должны быть освобождены после войны, а Германия должна искать свой рынок сбыта в Африке. Мацуока добавил, что Германия, конечно, получит доступ к природным ресурсам Юго-Восточной Азии и отдаленных регионов, но наш посол сразу же указал, что план Мацуоки потребует от Германии значительных жертв.

Он обращался не к ним, а к Кремлю через скрытый микрофон. Его речь была посвящена теме того, как Соединенные Штаты и Великобритания обманули Японию и подтолкнули к интервенции в Сибирь. Поступая таким образом, они помешали Японии и Советскому Союзу Союз от превращения в близких партнеров. Он выступал за установление тесных и сердечных отношений между двумя странами.

Matsuoka expressed his desire to put an end to the conflict in China as soon as possible and, in fact, asked the US president to provide him with good offices as a mediator between Japan and China. Matsuoka had already met Steinhardt in Tokyo, and he liked the man.

Ранее в тот же день они были одеты в свои деловые костюмы для посещения Кремля, но для церемонии подписания Мацуока приказал им переодеться в военную форму. Бросаясь в глаза своей внешностью, они боялись, что их униформа оскорбит чувствительность хозяев. [SOV.GetLeader] добродушно произнес тост в честь Фудзии:\n\n- Я вижу, что Вы - морской офицер. Эти американцы строят корабли без способных моряков.\n\nМацуока присоединился к нему:\n\n- Мистер [SOV.GetLeader], эти люди миниатюрны на вид, но их решимость тверда. Их дух - это тот фактор, который помог Японии победить в русско-японской войне.\n\nПомощник Мацуоки считал, что это не следует переводить, но Мацуока настаивал. [SOV.GetLeader] не потерял самообладания. Беспричинное оскорбление Мацуоки было хорошо рассчитано. Он хотел, чтобы [SOV.GetLeader] знал, что японские военные были готовы к войне, но в то же время он имел в виду и своих внутренних недоброжелателей.

Сталин неожиданно появился на вокзале. Он тепло обнял Мацуоку и обменялся словами о том, что две страны вместе могли бы решить проблемы в Европе, Азии и даже во всем мире. Несколько позже Сталин обратился к немецкому военному атташе полковнику Кребсу, сначала убедился, что он немец, а затем сказал ему:\n\n- Мы останемся с вами друзьями — в любом случае!\n\nЗатем Сталин лично поднялся на борт поезда, осмотрел кухню и другие помещения и приказал присутствующим сотрудникам хорошо заботиться о его гостях. Перед отъездом он даже пожал руку Хасигути Широ, камердинеру Мацуоки. Когда надпись "МОСКВА" отошла на задний план, Мацуока и его окружение продолжали наслаждаться сладким ароматом победы."

 NW_JAP.542.t: "Appointment of a New Lord Keeper of the Privy Seal"
 NW_JAP.542.d: "В связи со смертью Сайто Макото, лорда-хранителя Малой печати, нам необходимо выбрать нового человека на эту роль. Первоначально выдвигали Цунео Мацудайру – известного дипломата, посла в Соединённом Королевстве, и тестя брата императора, Ясухито, но последний настоял на том, чтобы вместо этого Мацудайра занял освободившийся пост министра императорского двора – малозначащий пост, на котором его родственник не окажется под угрозой политических убийств. Связано это с тем, что должность Лорда-хранителя Малой печати в последние годы становится особенно важна на фоне угасания института государственных старейшин (гэнро) и того, что именно Лорд-хранитель является тем, кто определяет контакты императора с политиками и сановниками.\n\nСейчас же в качестве кандидатур рассматриваются два человека. Первый это Юаса Курахей, который не принадлежит к аристократии и не имеет опыта работы в качестве министра кабинета. Однако сам император его высоко ценит за его умеренную, строгую и честную личность, которая держится на определённой дистанции и от военных, и политических партий, таким образом устанавливая впервые за долгое время на этот важный пост нейтрального человека.\n\nДругим вариантом может стать Фумимаро Коноэ – протеже господина Сайондзи, которого хотят видеть на этом посту сам Юаса Курахей, занимающий последние три года должность министра императорского двора, и президент Тайного совета Итики Китокуро. В настоящий момент Коноэ занимает пост спикера Палаты пэров. Однако он не желает в настоящий момент занимать пост лорда-хранителя Малой печати, ссылаясь на «болезнь». Вероятно, это связано с тем, что в таком случае Коноэ окажется между реформаторами из своего окружения и консерваторами из своих учителей. Поэтому чтобы уговорить его занять этот пост, придётся пойти на какие-то дополнительные уступки."

 NW_JAP.543.d.a: "The Lord Keeper of the Privy Seal, Yuasa Kurahei, has decided to retire for health reasons. Despite the fact that he is only 66 years old, which is not a record for Japanese politics, he has recently begun to feel much worse and this has begun to interfere with his duties.\n\nIn his place, on the recommendation of several high–ranking officials at once: Prince Konoe, Yuasa himself and others, a young aristocrat Kōichi Kido, a friend and associate of Fumimaro Konoe, is proposed. Kido proved himself during the February 26 incident, keeping the emperor in touch with Genrō Saionji, and has held several ministerial posts since then. However, Kido is only 50 years old, which is an exceptional example in the practice of appointing to such an important position, since he will be in charge of the emperor's entire relationship with his subjects and members of the government, but his candidacy is also approved by the army and right-wing circles."

 NW_JAP.544.t: "New Premier Election System"
 NW_JAP.544.desc: "The Meiji Constitution does not contain any legal provisions regarding the procedure for appointing a Prime Minister. Officially, the emperor, who was the "general ruler of the government," was supposed to exercise the right of appointment at will, without being limited by legal provisions or the desires of his subjects. However, if the Prime Minister made a mistake, then the Emperor would be responsible for the appointment, and although this had to be avoided, it was also necessary to maintain the format in which the Emperor personally appoints the Prime Minister. After much trial and error during the Meiji period, this issue was resolved – nine unofficial advisers to the emperor, Genrō, give him advice on whom to appoint as head of the Cabinet of Ministers, and the monarch "agrees" with their candidacy.\n\nHowever, such a decision could not be permanent due to the natural aging and death of the advisers. By the end of the Taishō period, only the great Saionji Kinmochi remained alive. Starting from this period, the emperors raised the issue of a new procedure for appointing a prime minister. Now is the time for the urgent need to choose her, as it is known that Saionji's days are numbered. Among the options being considered are the following:"
 NW_JAP.544.a: "The  Lord Keeper of the Privy Seal will choose a candidate"

 NW_JAP.545.t: "Kitokurō Resigns"
 NW_JAP.545.d.a: "The head of the Privy Council, Ichiki Kitokurō, wants to resign amid the events that have occurred. He is a henchman of Genrō Saionji and an important asset of the liberal elite faction, as the Privy Council continues to play a role in the government system, despite attempts to reform or even eliminate it. Kitokurō himself, according to the old tradition, gives a recommendation for choosing his successor before leaving. His choice fell on Kiichirō Hiranuma, the baron, the gray cardinal of Japan's judicial system, and the head of the right–wing Kokuhonsha society, which has more than 200,000 members, including many generals of the Kodoha faction, nationalist and traditionalist politicians. Hiranuma had long coveted the post of head of the Privy Council, but in 1934 he was prevented from doing so by Saionji – the conflict between these two people has been going on for more than a decade, as Saionji seeks to liberalize Japanese politics, and Hiranuma wants to at least prevent this, if not even reverse some changes. However, suddenly Hiranuma himself and his supporters proposed to elect the elderly Kiyoura Keigo, an 85–year-old politician, a man of the same generation as Saionji, who once headed both the government and the Privy Council, as head of the Privy Council." 
 NW_JAP.545.d.b: "$NW_JAP.545.d.a$\n\nHowever, Saionji himself wants Kitokurō to continue in office in order to prevent opponents of democracy from using the Privy Council to promote their ideas."

 NW_JAP.546.t: "Dissolution of the Kokuhonsha"
 NW_JAP.546.d: "Today, by the decision of its chairman, Baron Kiichiro Hiranuma, the Kokuhonsha society, which he founded in 1924 when he was Minister of Justice and leader of the House of Peers, is self-dissolving. It called on Japanese patriots to reject various foreign political 'isms' (such as socialism, communism, Marxism, anarchism, etc.) in favor of a rather vaguely defined 'Japanese national spirit' (kokutai). The name 'kokuhon' was chosen as an antithesis to the word 'minpon', from 'minpon shugi', the commonly used translation of the word 'democracy'. Accordingly, the Secret Society openly supported totalitarian ideology. Genro Saionji Kinmochi publicly criticized the organization for promoting a Japanese variety of fascism.\n\nIncluded in the Kokuhonsha were many of Hiranuma's colleagues from the Ministry of Home Affairs, important businessmen, as well as some of the most influential generals and admirals, including Sadao Araki, Jinzaburo Masaki, Saito Makoto, and Yamakawa Kenziro, and war hero Admiral Togo Heihachiro served as honorary vice-chairman. By 1936, the organization claimed to have more than 200,000 members in 170 branches. The Kokuhonsha published a monthly newspaper called 'Kokuhon' and acted as a political support group for Hiranuma.\n\nIn Kokuhon, they openly advocated a concept they called Kokumin Zentaishugi ('National Totalitarianism'), which sought to 'incorporate all parts of the Japanese state and society into one all-encompassing whole.' According to Kokuhon, the idea of Kokumin Zentaishugi was better suited to the mentality of the Japanese people than Western democracy, stating that 'the Japanese, unlike the Chinese or Jews, are incapable of living without a state.'\n\nAfter a recent incident, Hiranuma apparently decided that the organization had fulfilled its role and he no longer needed it. It is likely that he is thus showing that, having obtained the post of head of the Privy Council (directly or indirectly), and against the backdrop of the radicalism of young officers and the fact that many members of the Kokuhonsha supported the conspirators, he is ready to compromise with the liberal elites, as reformers of various stripes turned out to be too radical even for him after the series of murders that took place."

 NW_JAP.547.t: "Probationary Supervision Law for Political Offenses" 
 NW_JAP.547.d: "For several years, Baron Hiranuma has been trying to revise the Peace Preservation Law to strengthen it by introducing a procedure for preventive detention. Today, he is again trying to overcome resistance, primarily parliamentary, by putting forward a new bill for discussion at the 69th session of parliament, which is not formally a revision of existing legislation.\n\nThe creator of the new law is Takeichiro Moriyama, director of the probation department of the Ministry of Justice. Moriyama, who is responsible for the bill, stated that 'we have completely discarded the existing circumstances and developed the bill on a completely new basis,' and stressed that the Probation Law for Offenders was based on 'protective guidance' rather than 'intimidation and oppression.' The purpose of the law is to 'prevent the re-offending of those who have changed their ideology, and to encourage those who have not changed their ideology to change their ideology.' This refers to the practice promoted by the secret police of 'changing views' among those convicted under the Peace Preservation Law, where a person officially declared that he had abandoned his former ideas (most often communist or Marxist) and remembered his 'Japanese spirit.'\n\nDuring the parliamentary debates, the left-wing independent politician Kato KanjQ spoke out against the bill, pointing out that the recidivism rate among violators of the Peace Preservation Law was low, at about 3 percent (compared to about 35 percent for ordinary crimes), and that the bill would violate the constitutional right to freedom of residence and movement."

The original book was published in Munich on December 15, 1934, and is a massive work of over 1600 pages, created through the joint efforts of more than 100 Nazi scholars. The Japanese translator is Haruyo Shinozuka, a Bachelor of Laws. As the brochure's table of contents states: 'People often say that the Nazis had no unique theory. Is this really the case? This work is one of the answers to this question... I hope and expect that by printing this, we can create a great research project in our country that will surpass the Nazis.' As is known, the initiator of the translation and publication of such a work is Baron Kiichiro Hiranuma, the author of the Peace Preservation Law, the main lobbyist for strict criminal legislation, and the leader of the conservative part of the elites."

There are already several suitable candidates to replace him. First and foremost is Prince Konoe, who has long been prepared for this role by the elderly genro Saionji Kinmochi. Now Konoe himself, who had previously refused the offer to become prime minister several times, has announced that he is ready to take power. Another possible candidate is the leader of the group of bureaucratic reformers, Fumio Goto, a man who has already been a cabinet minister and even acting prime minister during the young officers' putsch. A third possible person could be General Kanji Ishiwara, the leader of the Manchurian faction within the army, which is known for having organized the seizure of Manchuria, thanks to which Ishiwara became a popular figure among young and middle-ranking officers. He has rather unusual views, as he is, for example, an opponent of war with China and a staunch supporter of Pan-Asianism."

Realizing that he was close to death, Saionji distributed money to close friends as commemorative gifts. In November, he developed pyelonephritis, and although he fully recovered, he could not bear the weakness and finally passed away on the evening of November 24 at 9:54 PM. He was 92 years old at the time of his death. Saionji had expressed his intention to refuse a state funeral, saying, 'Even after death, I will not need the care of monks or Shinto priests.' Nevertheless, a grand state funeral was held in Hibiya Park. Tens of thousands of people attended, and 8,000 people visited Zagyoso, which was opened to the public on the same day."

 NW_JAP.552.d: "At the first meeting of the Imperial Parliament after the suppression of the military rebellion, Hisashi Aso, the general secretary of the Shakai Taishuto party, delivered a speech on behalf of the party:\n\n- I believe that the key to national reform lies in stabilizing the lives of the people and giving society hope for tomorrow, while dealing a decisive blow to capitalist institutions, carrying out decisive internal reforms, and breaking old political abuses through the forced implementation of the Showa Restoration.\n\n'Being determined to carry out the Showa Restoration and internal reforms' — were these not the heroic words of the Young Officers in the days of the past putsch? Perhaps that is why, unlike other congressmen, Aso did not criticize the behavior of the military or the generals of the Kodoha faction at this parliamentary session. This is not surprising; his faction within the party, ever since the publication of the 'Army Pamphlet' in 1934, has taken a benevolent position towards the military and their desire to build a national defense state. They are ready to support them in exchange for the implementation of some socialist reforms. In the elections, his party, the only left-wing party in parliament, increased its number of deputy mandates to 24 people.\n\nAnother member of the Diet, Takao Saito, a member of the Rikken Minseito party, boldly criticized the concept of the Showa Restoration: 'Praise the transformation of the country, but do not know what the transformation of the country is; praise the Showa Restoration, but do not understand what the Showa Restoration is.'"
 NW_JAP.552.a: "It is hard to realize that even in parliament, there were defenders of the conspirators' actions"

At the same time, Aso also said directly: 'The reform of our country must be centered on the parliament and carried out through the parliament, that is, parliamentary politics. Therefore, the biggest political priority today should be the reform of the parliament. The parliament itself must be able to correctly reflect the needs of life and the hopes of the people.'"

The Bureau of Military Affairs and the Bureau of Equipment and Supplies of the Ministry of Defense proposed a sum of 2.3 billion yen for twenty-two projects under the plan. Major Tadashi Katakura presented this plan to General Seishiro Itagaki, Chief of Staff of the Kwantung Army, who agreed to it."

 NW_JAP.555.t: "The Only Officer with an Iron Neck"
 NW_JAP.555.d: "It is believed that Colonel Kanji Ishiwara, the initiator of the seizure of Manchuria in 1931, played the greatest role in the suppression. Despite the fact that many young officers among the putschists counted on Ishiwara's support, and in fact admired his actions, he, being appointed head of martial law in Tokyo, carried out the most consistent and tough policy towards the conspirators. Although the emperor's instructions were to quickly attack the rebels' positions, in the martial law headquarters itself there were fierce and emotional disagreements over the prospect of a military confrontation.\n\nIshiwara's sheer willpower broke through the fog of hesitation at headquarters. On the evening of the second day of the mutiny, several officers sympathetic to the rebels came to the headquarters to demand a postponement of action against the rebels. Their passionate and eloquent appeal made a deep impression on most of those present at the crowded meeting. Ishiwara listened in silence for a long time to the vacillations of the other officers, after which he rose from the corner of the huge table at which the martial law staff sat and announced in a loud voice:\n\n- We will immediately begin preparations for the assault. All units will assemble for this purpose. Stepping to the door, he stopped and, turning, added, 'The army will wait until noon tomorrow, then it will begin the offensive and suppress this uprising.'\n\nHe gave several specific orders to the various assault units and then withdrew. If ever there was a right man in the right place, it was Colonel Ishiwara."

 NW_JAP.556.desc: "In June 1933, a group of young investors, the Banchokai, acquired 100,000 shares of Teijin (a leading rayon and textile firm) from the Bank of Taiwan at a price of 125 yen per share. The shares steadily rose in price, reaching 200 yen per share by the end of the year, and rumors began to appear in the editorial pages of various newspapers that the Banchokai had somehow managed to manipulate the market.\n\nWorking with this unfounded rumor, ultra-right-wing officials in the Ministry of Justice accused officials in the Ministry of Finance and members of the Saito Cabinet of colluding with the Bank of Taiwan to allow the Banchokai to buy shares at an artificially low price in exchange for cash and stock bribes. In April 1934, the Ministry of Justice ordered the arrest of the Deputy Minister of Finance, the director of the Bank of Taiwan, and the president of Teijin. Upon receiving news that a number of cabinet ministers were also to be arrested, Prime Minister Saito dissolved the government on July 3, 1934. Shortly thereafter, thirteen more officials were arrested on corruption charges. In total, corruption charges were brought against 16 people. The trial began in 1935.\n\nBut today, after 265 trials, all the defendants were acquitted. The court stated that the stock trading was conducted correctly and, therefore, the defendants were innocent. But the public still feels the taste of corruption, both within the bureaucracy and in the financial world, and this has undermined confidence in both the ideology of liberalism and the market economy. Back in 1934, there was talk that the entire prosecution was the result of a conspiracy by the faction of Fusanosuke Kuhara, one of the leaders of the Rikken SeiyQkai, the judicial elder and deputy chairman of the Privy Council Hiranuma Kiichiro, the military, and the right wing. A critic of this approach, the entrepreneur Muto Sanji, was killed by a right-wing fanatic in 1934."

 NW_JAP.557.d: "In response to calls for the need to answer the question of kokutai, the government formed a committee of Japan's leading professors to discuss this issue. As a result of their work, they released a document titled Kokutai no Hongi (Fundamental Principles of the National Polity). It was a 156-page brochure, officially published by the Ministry of Education of Japan. This brochure is intended primarily for distribution among teachers throughout the country, but will also be sold openly to anyone who wishes.\n\nThe brochure contains the official position of the Japanese state on all aspects of domestic policy, international relations, culture, and civilization. It clearly states its purpose: to overcome social unrest and create a new Japan. In this brochure, students are taught to put the interests of the nation above their own, and that they are part of the state, not separate from it. It also explains the principle of hakko ichiu ('eight corners, one roof'). Defining the national polity as 'The Great Japanese Empire will be governed forever in accordance with the divine decree of the Emperor, who has been a continuous line of emperors for centuries. This is our national polity, which will never change,' it not only rejects communism and anarchism, but also considers democracy and liberalism incompatible with the national polity.\n\nA separate point criticizes the theory of the emperor as an organ of the state: 'The Emperor is the subject of sovereignty, and the theory that the subject of sovereignty is the state, and the emperor is merely its organ, has no basis other than the uncritical borrowing of Western nationalist theory. The Emperor is not simply the so-called head of state, monarch, sovereign, or ruling authority in foreign states, but governs this country in accordance with the just cause that has existed since the founding of the country, and Article 3 states that 'The Emperor is sacred and inviolable' to make this clear. Similar provisions found in foreign states are, of course, not based on such a deep meaning, but are merely an attempt to secure the position of the head of state by law.'"

 NW_JAP.558.d: "At a meeting of the Imperial Parliament, Sobei Hara of the Rikken SeiyQkai party asked the Minister of Education a question about a fragment from 'The Meaning of Kokutai,' which stated: 'This is not the rule of the Emperor and the people, and it is not a system of separation of the three powers or a system of rule of law, but rather a system of direct rule by the Emperor.' He asked:\n\n- If this is not a 'system of rule of law,' then where is the Japanese system of rule of law? If there is even a great body of laws for governing the country, such as the Meiji Constitution, is it not a country governed by law?\n\nThe Minister of Education replied that he would like to consider this matter carefully, and at the moment the 'Fundamental Principles of Kokutai' had not yet become 'sacred scripture,' so there might be some amendments in the future. In addition, many members of the cabinet had not yet read the brochure on the meaning of kokutai that was now being distributed."

 NW_JAP.559.t: "The Way of the Subjects"
 NW_JAP.559.d: "One of the main themes of the book is dedicated to the direct descent of Emperor Showa from the goddess Amaterasu and the religious characterization of Kokutai, which was defined as a 'theocracy' in which 'The Way of the Emperor's subjects comes from the Emperor's policy and consists in guarding and maintaining the Imperial Throne, which coexists with heaven and earth.' Emperor Showa and his war (seisen) are described as 'holy.' The virtues he embodied were unique and unchanging.\n\n'The Imperial Family is the source of the Japanese nation, and national and private life spring from this. The way of the subject is to be loyal to the Emperor, without caring for oneself, thereby supporting the Imperial Throne, which coexists with Heaven and Earth.'\n\nFilial piety and loyalty were the highest virtues of the subjects of the imperial state, and the book condemned 'individualism,' liberalism, utilitarianism, and materialism, which endangered these virtues: 'the country has been infected with perverted thinking, and it is our sacred duty to cleanse it and return to the virtuous customs of our ancestors. It is by working in harmony and cooperation and displaying our national dignity that we must obey the Heavenly Spirits of our Ancestors properly, which, by working in harmony with others, will contribute to the greater glory of the Throne.'\n\nThe brochure also claims that the Western powers have for centuries sought world domination and have been very successful in this, as evidenced by the fact that only a few thousand Europeans now ruled over 450 million Asians. The Western value system, based on greed and self-indulgence, is considered guilty of countless bloody aggressive wars and the current world economic crisis. America was singled out for special criticism, with mention of black slavery and the mistreatment of minorities and immigrants.\n\nOther sections are devoted to correct social and moral customs, some racial and eugenic ideas, theology and religion, military doctrines, and other aspects of Japanese customs."

This was the final step in establishing a genuine one-party state. After these statements, the major newspaper publishers Ogata and Tokutomi used their influence to secure the approval of the membership of the members of the Diet of the Tohokai party, which they supported, in the Association, while the party itself, after negotiations with its leader Seigo Nakano, will be transformed into a non-political association for moral thought called the Toho Jikai, 'Society of Eastern Comrades.'

The party was only returning to this role, and its spirit was indestructible. However, he added that he 'felt a weariness from twelve years of fierce struggle suddenly descend upon him.' Originally, the party (besides the Youth Corps) had branches in twenty prefectures, as well as in Tokyo, with about 15,000 members.

Two main lecture series are devoted to Hideyoshi and the short-lived but famous Kemmu Restoration of 1333.\n\nMeanwhile, he had to resort to an alternative way of venting his irrepressible energy, reflecting on and discussing heroic episodes of past eras, while at the same time hoping that the seeds sown in the minds of his listeners would prepare them for new efforts when the opportunity arose. His lectures on the Kemmu Restoration were written quite well, although he read them not as a specialist, but with the aim of commenting on current events and his own experience.\n\nSince he is under increasingly close surveillance by the Special Higher ('Thought') Police and the Kempeitai, he has no other alternative but to speak in terms of national politics or restorationist rhetoric, although he has an additional motive for this, as he has begun to support Japanist politicians who are steadily becoming more hostile to the Tojo regime. In expressing his own views, he is forced to resort to more or less indirect historical allusions, often displaying his good ironic wit."
 NW_JAP.564.a: "Nakano remains a popular figure"
 NW_JAP.565.t: "The World Thrives on Personality"
 NW_JAP.565.d: "Recently, Seigo Nakano delivered a speech to a wide audience at Waseda University, which he himself had graduated from, which he called 'The World Thrives on Personality.' The title comes from a classic Chinese proverb: 'A state thrives on personality and is destroyed because of personality.' Beginning with a review of the complex military situation, Nakano elaborated on the irony of the situation where officials responsible for material production, such as Nobusuke Kishi, pay primary attention to issues of morale.\n\nHe also condemned Kishi's distinction between the 'Anglo-American' or 'Jewish' pursuit of profit, associated with liberalism, and the 'Japanese spirit' of completely selfless service, pointing out that long before Western influence was felt, Mitsui, Noike, and the proverbial Zeniya Goh diligently sought profit. This does not need to be condemned as long as private initiative and creativity are guided by public interests, as opposed to the suffocation of their organic life by mechanical submission to bureaucratic control. The latter, as he had often argued before, was the real 'Jewish mentality.'"
 NW_JAP.565.a: "Nakano... remembered that he was once a liberal?"
 NW_JAP.566.t: "Criticism of Bureaucrats"
 NW_JAP.566.d: "Nakano analyzed the history of the strengthening of bureaucratic control in Japan. According to him, before the Manchurian Incident, the useless alternation of 'positive' and 'negative' policies was criticized by both right-wing opponents of liberalism and pacifism, and by left-wing intellectuals. Many of the latter suffered from repression, but less dedicated people entered the bureaucratic apparatus and comfortably overcame their radicalism. When reforms became necessary after Manchuria, the army, as its main defender, rejected the parliamentary parties, but was forced to replace them on the political scene with bureaucratic reformers, whose only theoretical resource was the semi-leftist views left over from their student days. Therefore, they adopted an unreasonable policy of rationalization through amalgamation, putting quantity above quality and combining the vices of monopolistic capitalism and state control. Nakano cited specific cases revealed during the investigations of his Youth Corps."
 NW_JAP.566.a: "Nakano strikes back"
 NW_JAP.567.t: "Japanese Patriotic Liberalism"
 NW_JAP.567.d: "Returning to basic theory, he condemned the current fashion of belittling any liberalism as an Anglo-American ideology. Praising the slogan 'Give me liberty or give me death!', he interpreted it as an affirmation of the supreme responsibility of the individual, who can achieve more than any system of coercion. The pioneering liberalism of Itagaki Taisuke, he said, was completely Japanese and patriotic, as it arose from his observations of how, during the campaign to suppress the opposition to the Meiji Restoration, the peasantry in the hostile feudal domain of Aizu was completely indifferent to the outcome, because feudalism had deprived them of all sense of belonging to society and deprived them of freedom of choice and responsibility. Therefore, Itagaki sought to provide the Japanese people with a social stake and commitment to ensuring all their efforts for the greatness of their country. Japanese liberalism, therefore, was not anti-monarchical, as its Western counterpart often was, but merely opposed an official system that denied the rights of the people. In contrast to Kishi's approach, Nakano continued to promote a policy of stimulating the masses and self-sacrifice on the part of those in leadership positions, since the latter should be most endowed with public spirit (as patriots). He was particularly moved by the example of Clemenceau, who, in times of greatest danger to France, swept away a corrupt administration, won over rebellious workers, and inspired the troops by personal example at the front. It was clear enough that Nakano hoped that another Clemenceau would appear in Japan to save the situation, a role he would have been more than willing to play himself, although in the Japanese style, a more high-ranking person might have been required as the main hero."
 NW_JAP.567.a: "Nakano wants to become the Japanese Clemenceau..."
 NW_JAP.568.t: "The Second Speech"
 NW_JAP.568.d: "After urging the students to write their own 'Mein Kampf,' Nakano concluded his speech with a call to abandon opportunism, the root of all evils:\n\n- The great ship of Japan is drifting on a stormy sea, endangered by a whole detachment of opportunists. Awaken yourselves! Let the world thrive through each individual! I sincerely hope for this, my beloved fellow graduates.\n\nHe repeated this speech in a more popular form at the Hibiya Hall under the title 'Form a National Battle Order for a Certain Victory!', although in it he expressed disapproval of 'direct action' (terrorism) as a manifestation of simple aspiration without guiding principles. The police did not intervene because of the frantic enthusiasm of the large crowd of 4,000 people who paid the usual 30 yen to fill the hall to capacity, while twice as many people gathered outside. However, all further public speeches by Nakano were banned.\n\nBans and censorship of 'Tairiku,' Nakano's publication, were tightened, and even the latest issue of 'Asahi Shimbun' was banned for publishing an article by Nakano on wartime prime ministers. Although this was done with the help of cautious historical allusions, some of them were very eloquent, for example, the fact that Generals Hindenburg and Ludendorff were magnificent on the battlefield, but when they received supreme control over the war, they failed to show proper trust in the people, instead restricting them and 'trampling on their patriotism,' imposing on them a military policy and slavish hard labor."
 NW_JAP.568.a: "How did he manage to combine a call for liberalism and the book of a Nazi ideologue in one speech..."
 NW_JAP.569.t: "Confrontation in Parliament"
 NW_JAP.569.d: "A round of protests was directed against the amended Special Wartime Crimes Law, which prohibited any action aimed at disrupting the work of the National Government. The opposition in the regular advisory committee was led by Seigo Nakano's assistant, Takeo Mitamura, probably because of his legal background. He argued that the ban on any initiative to change a particular cabinet would turn it into a dictatorship that could not be challenged constitutionally.\n\nExtremist patriotic societies actively lobbied and agitated against the proposed law. Since such steps to strengthen the government were linked to plans to tighten economic control, which threatened a significant share of the zaibatsu in the management system, it is likely that the alliance between the zaibatsu and the Japanists was still ongoing. At the same time, emotional factors, such as dissatisfaction with the meager share of influence of the far right, must have played a certain role. An alliance of fifteen right-wing groups distributed several brochures denouncing the bill, which gave the current government an inviolability equal to the eternal state structure, and thus amounted to a new shogunate.\n\nA prominent representative of the opposition was Amano Tatsuo, a lawyer with exceptional fanaticism. In a recent issue of the newspaper 'Ishin Kuron,' he wrote that Tojo was using the war to usurp the emperor's prerogatives - like the shoguns and other similar villains of the restorationist ilk - and described him as a 'traitor and rebel, destroying the calm order in the national state,' who is in the power of 'pseudo-renouncers of communism.' As a result, he was arrested for a time. These efforts of the right were supported in parliament by such party liberals as Ichiro Hatoyama and Miki Bukichi, but the influence of the ruling party on the majority of parliament members allowed the bill to pass."
 NW_JAP.569.a: "Is there any chance of stopping Tojo?"
 NW_JAP.570.t: "Protest in Parliament"
 NW_JAP.570.d: "Another confrontation occurred at a special session of parliament convened to pass two important economic control measures, when the right wing, including supporters of Seigo Nakano, formed a special society to coordinate the opposition. But since the three-day session was limited to formalities, the only opportunity to express protest was a meeting of members of the Imperial Rule Assistance Political Association, at which the liberals Hatoyama, Bukichi Miki, and the fascist Seigo Nakano took an active joint position, and Nakano condemned corruption in the government by 'sycophants.'\n\nAfter this, there was an incident with Akao Bin, this young leader of right-wing extremist groups publicly reprimanded the prime minister during a speech, after which he was expectedly expelled from parliament and from the ruling party. After that, those who voted against his expulsion, Nakano, Hatoyama, and others, left the party in protest."
 NW_JAP.570.a: "They can't do anything"
 NW_JAP.571.t: "A Weaving Conspiracy"
 NW_JAP.571.d.a: "Various specific reports of dissatisfaction with the current government and attempts to remove it have begun to come in. One of the first was information about a meeting at the home of Yoshida Shigeru of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, which was attended by Kojima Kazuo, Ikeda of the Mitsui zaibatsu, and military personnel from the Kodoha faction, who discussed the possibility of forming a cabinet headed by General Ugaki, apparently the most acceptable figure in the army outside the Toseiha faction. It is also known that Prince Konoe is obsessed with the danger of communist subversion if the war drags on or ends too catastrophically, while Kiichiro Hiranuma suspected Tojo himself of 'red ideas.'\n\nIn the government, Matsumae Shigeyoshi of the Ministry of Communications compiled a 150-page report on the technical shortcomings of military production and distributed it among former prime ministers and naval circles, including Prince Takamatsu, a captain and the emperor's brother. In addition, a senior researcher at the Planning Board, Tanabe Tadao, published an article with critical remarks in the latest issue of 'Ishin Kuron,' which attracted the attention of Seigo Nakano, who is currently considered to be the main driving force behind the conspiracy."
 NW_JAP.571.d.b: "$NW_JAP.571.d.a$\n\nThe only real possibility for the success of the movement against the prime minister is the mobilization of high-ranking statesmen who have been given the right to appoint prime ministers - a group consisting of all former prime ministers, the Lord Keeper of the Privy Seal Kido Koichi, and the chairman of the Privy Council. Kido in this group is our main ally, as it was he who was largely responsible for Tojo's appointment as prime minister and is unwilling to even think about changing the cabinet in wartime, so he does everything possible to inform the head of the cabinet of any actions against him, and in addition he keeps the emperor largely isolated from other elements."
 NW_JAP.571.a: "It's that Nakano again"
 NW_JAP.572.t: "Nakano and the Senior Vassals"
 NW_JAP.572.d: "Nakano did not see the high-ranking statesmen as promising material and spoke of them as those who needed to be constantly wound up like puppets. In the past, he had attacked them all with a certain amount of bitterness, sometimes ironically for being indifferent to the policies of the military, but he realized that there was no other way. Therefore, he created a network of collaborators, trying to influence them. He formed a particularly close alliance with Tatsuo Amano, whose article against Tojo in the newspaper 'Ishin Kuron' had impressed him, although Amano's earlier connection with terrorism would have been a hindrance from the point of view of the high-ranking statesmen. Contact was established with Matsumae by visiting him in the hospital, and with Tanabe through one of the ubiquitous natives of Fukuoka named Hinoshita, who was on his staff. Nakano arranged for Tanabe to travel to Konoe, and then he drew up a 'Plan for the Reconstruction of the Military Economy.' Additional data on the private sector of the economy were obtained from Tsuda Shingo of the Kanebo zaibatsu, who provided constant support to Nakano during this period. Immediately after leaving the ruling party, Nakano visited Prince Naruhiko, the emperor's uncle and a member of the Supreme War Council, with whom he had previously maintained contact and who was already sometimes considered a potential prime minister."
 NW_JAP.572.a: "Let's try to offer Nakano some government position, maybe he'll calm down"
 NW_JAP.573.t: "Movement Against the Cabinet"
 NW_JAP.573.d: "New information has been received from the secret police about the movement against the government. The campaign was organized during a visit at the end of July to the mountain resort of Karuizawa, where Prince Konoe, General Ugaki, and the former party leader Hatoyama had their villas. In addition to taking his son with him, Seigo Nakano was accompanied by the lawyer Tatsuo Amano and his son, Nakano's right-hand man, Takeo Mitamura, and his secretary, Hinoshita. Shigeyoshi Matsumae traveled separately and paid a visit to Konoe, asking him to work with the emperor, while Hinoshita presented his and Tanabe's 'reconstruction plan' to all three prominent political figures. Nakano Yasuo recalls delivering a sealed message to Konoe's villa and arranging a telephone meeting with Ugaki at one of the several dinners that Hatoyama treated the conspirators to.\n\nNakano returned to Tokyo in an optimistic mood. It so happened that Yoshida Shigeru was traveling on the same train. Shortly thereafter, Mitamura prepared a brochure under his own name, 'The Management of the IRAA and the Kokutai Constitution,' in which he explained the reasons for his departure from the Imperial Rule Assistance Political Association. In it, he criticized the single national party system as a new shogunate and condemned the way the monolithic Tojo regime, combining the government, the IRAA, and the APT, had deprived the Diet of its constitutional function of overseeing the executive branch: 'It is important to leave the way open for criticism of the administration. Without criticism, there is no reflection. Without reflection, there is no improvement. Criticism encourages purposeful efforts, and such efforts are a national asset.' Two thousand of its copies were distributed to members of parliament, ministers, privy councilors, newspapers, and prominent intellectuals, although a ban on their publication soon followed, naturally."
 NW_JAP.573.a: "We will continue to monitor them"
 NW_JAP.573.b: "We must teach Shigeyoshi a lesson, as he poses a great threat" 
 NW_JAP.574.t: "Mobilization of Shigeyoshi Matsumae"
 NW_JAP.574.d: "Shigeyoshi Matsumae, Director General of the Engineering Bureau of the Ministry of Communications and a young representative of the bureaucratic reformers, has been mobilized for military service. This was done thanks to an urgent amendment to the Military Service Law: previously, it stipulated that the maximum age of conscripts was 40 (and Matsumae is now 42), but now it has been raised to 45. It took only three days to consider this amendment. He was drafted as a private and sent to the front. The reason for this was that Matsumae had gathered engineers to conduct a thorough investigation into the huge difference in production capacity between Japan and the United States and had distributed the results to the military command and Prince Konoe, hoping for Tojo's resignation. Even many of Tojo's opponents in the army were outraged by such a blatant violation of the law for the sake of petty revenge and political struggle."
 NW_JAP.574.a: "At least he will teach the others a lesson"
 NW_JAP.575.t: "Meeting with the Senior Vassals"
 NW_JAP.575.d: "Concrete steps by the high-ranking statesmen began when Okada, at a meeting with Koichi Kido, suggested that Tojo could be appointed Chief of the General Staff and resign as prime minister. Kido replied that this could be done if 'public opinion' required it, which, he said, could be considered represented by the consensus of the high-ranking statesmen if necessary. Therefore, Okada secured the consent of the ex-prime ministers to meet with Tojo, inviting him to come alone in the hope that they could speak frankly and emphasize the general's personal responsibility for the work of the government. However, with Kido's support, the prime minister managed to insist on being accompanied by his usual public relations assistants (the ministers of foreign affairs, finance, and the navy, as well as the chairman of the Planning Board), as a result of which the high-ranking statesmen were unable to exert the necessary pressure."
 NW_JAP.575.a: "It's time to deal with Nakano and his group"
 NW_JAP.576.t: "Arrest of Takeo Mitamura"
 NW_JAP.576.d: "The other day, Seigo Nakano's closest assistant, Takeo Mitamura, was arrested. First, censorship officials interrogated him for a week about his brochure, which he had published more than a month ago, then he was interrogated in more detail by the Special Higher Police on suspicion of violating the Special Wartime Crimes Law, as well as on the actual case of inciting right-wing students to assassinate Tojo by a member of Tatsuo Amano's group 'Makotomusubi.' A copy of a document containing a list of the planned cabinet of General Ugaki by the conspirators also fell into the hands of the police. However, during the interrogations, Mitamura held up perfectly, relying on his legal and practical experience as a former police officer of the Ministry of Colonial Affairs."
 NW_JAP.576.a: "We need to arrest Nakano immediately"
 NW_JAP.577.t: "Resistance from Prosecutors"
 NW_JAP.577.d: "The head of the investigation department of the Prosecutor General's Office, Nakamura Toneo, refused to authorize Nakano's arrest, as the check on Mitamura had not yielded sufficient evidence. The prosecutors are apparently hostile to the prime minister, considering it their duty, as employees of the Ministry of Justice, to restrain the actions of the police and the Kempeitai. In addition, given the influence of Kiichiro Hiranuma in this ministry, they may well also regard Tojo with distrust, as a threat to national policy.\n\nAnd yet, early this morning, Seigo Nakano was temporarily arrested on the initiative of the police, along with all the officials of the Toho Jikai and Makotomusubi, a total of more than 100 people. He managed to give his son a copy of the 'Reconstruction of the Military Economy' before the police confiscated all the other documents, along with eleven swords from Nakano's personal collection.\n\nAlthough the police tried to get a confession from him for spreading false rumors, no particular progress was made, as they were unable to formulate enough evidence to satisfy the prosecutor's office. Meanwhile, Hatoyama and other activists were agitating in the parliament offices against the illegal detention of two deputies without charges. At a meeting convened at Tojo's residence to make a quick decision, Prosecutor General Matsuzaka denied that there were grounds for charging Nakano, while the dominant figure in the Imperial Rule Assistance Political Association, Asa Tadao, warned that parliament would not agree to Nakano's detention without charges during the session, as this contradicted Article 53 of the constitution."
 NW_JAP.577.a: "Tojo's protege, the head of the Tokyo branch of the Kempeitai, will put moral pressure on Nakano"
 NW_JAP.577.b: "Since both the judicial and executive branches are against us, we can't do anything with him"
 NW_JAP.578.t: "Nakano's Confession"
 NW_JAP.578.d: "Faced with such resistance from both the judicial and legislative branches, Tojo turned to his immediate support, the Kempeitai, and his closest protege in it, Colonel Shikata RyQji, who promised to obtain a confession from Nakano by the time of the arraignment the next day, in order to prevent him from attending parliament. Early in the morning, Nakano was secretly taken out of his cell, and at noon the Kempeitai reported to the Prosecutor General's Office his confession to spreading rumors that disagreements between the army and the navy had led to defeats at the front. The first thought of the editor-in-chief of the Asahi Shimbun, Taketaro Ogata, when he heard about the confession, was the possibility of torture, but there were no signs of torture on Nakano's body, who was released from detention.\n\nThe prosecutor Nakamura now had no choice but to accept a statement from Nakano in order to apply to the district court for a formal charge, which he still hoped would not be serious enough to justify Nakano's further detention. He ignored the meaningless additional charge of lese-majeste brought by the Kempeitai on the basis of contacts with Prince Naruhiko. However, when Nakano arrived, Nakamura was struck by his 'oriental humility.'\n\nThe parliament naturally did not agree to allow the detention of a deputy for such a minor crime, so Nakano was released home, albeit under the supervision of two policemen who were sent with him. He also gave a written undertaking that he would not attend parliamentary sessions to the head of the metropolitan military police."
 NW_JAP.578.a: "Nakano surrendered? Why? What happened?"
 NW_JAP.579.t: "Nakano Commits Harakiri"
 NW_JAP.579.d: "Nakano returned home early in the morning, accompanied by a policeman, who was later joined by another. He told his son: 'It's all over. I won't have to go there anymore.' The ambiguity of these phrases would only be understood by everyone later, as would his message to his assistant Mitamura 'not to follow him.' In his mother's room, he found the last remaining sword after the search, which he took to 'clean it.' In the evening, after what turned out to be a farewell dinner, he asked all family members to disperse by ten o'clock to let him rest, and the two policemen were placed in the guest room. Earlier, he had ordered the photographs of Hitler and Mussolini to be removed from his room and replaced them with a statue of Kusunoki Masashige on horseback and one volume of Saigo's biography. Then he was busy writing farewell notes until exactly midnight, when, after making two cuts on his stomach in observance of samurai traditions, he committed suicide by cutting his carotid artery.\n\nHis body was discovered the next morning. The two accompanying policemen denied having noticed anyone, and eventually the suspicions against them, which the local police were ready to investigate, were refuted by Nakano's personal doctor. He also noted that this would not have happened if Nakano's wife, who died of tuberculosis in 1934, had been alive. Several brief notes were found in the family altar in an envelope addressed to Toyama, the head of the Amur River Society. They were addressed to all of Nakano's relatives, his main colleagues, and various friends, even his late father, wife, and sons, in which he expressed the hope of reuniting with them. Other notes greeted the imperial army, in others he asked that his horses be properly cared for, and expressed gratitude to the family for having had the good fortune to gather one last time and find one remaining sword. Other records left by Nakano included a complaint about the dullness of the sword and his resignation from parliament, which indicates the responsibility he believed he shared with this institution for the grim prospects now facing Japan." 
 NW_JAP.579.a: "What influenced Nakano so much?"
 NW_JAP.580.t: "Nakano's Devotion"
 NW_JAP.580.d: "Naturally, there was much speculation about the motives for Nakano's suicide. The key to the mystery is a remark made by the policeman who remained in Nakano's house to his son: 'Your father was very worried about both of you.' This seems to mean that since Nakano's eldest surviving son had already been drafted into the army, and the younger was about to be drafted, the chief of the metropolitan military police could threaten to deal with them, perhaps by sending them to a combat zone where they would have no hope of survival. Choosing between the lives of his sons and continuing his political activities, he chose the former. But since he felt his personal responsibility for the start of the war, coupled with his inability to influence politics any longer, which he had been doing for the past 15 years, it led him to the thought of taking his own life.\n\nThe two social groups most agitated by this event were, on the one hand, representatives of the small business class, who formed the core of Nakano's supporters, and, on the other hand, the ultranationalists, whose ideology was the source of many of his statements, especially in the early and late stages of his activity. Representatives of the first group were most noticeable at his funeral, which, despite the ban by officials, was attended by 20,000 mourners, including a large number of politicians and journalists. One of Konoe's advisers commented:\n\n- I was struck by the grandeur of the funeral, rare in recent times. There were twenty or thirty wreaths, baskets of flowers, and floral arrangements, all from anonymous donors. When I inquired, I was told that they were mainly individuals or organizations belonging to the more modest class of medium and small businessmen.\n\nThis seems to have made an impression on the right-wing traditionalists. Honma Ken'ichiro, a representative of this group, describes Nakano's death as a 'redemptive ablution,' continuing with the words:\n\n- Our offering in his memory is to continue his struggle to expel the bureaucrats as a rearguard. What purpose would the repetition of sutras by thousands or myriads of monks serve? Even if we lit incense torches and offered a whole forest of flowers in sacrifice, Nakano would not be satisfied. Blood can only be redeemed by blood."

 NW_JAP.581 .c: "And who are they?"
 NW_JAP.582.t: "Ishiwara's Character"
 NW_JAP.582.d: "Despite his sharp analytical mind and strategic thinking, Ishiwara's weakness lies elsewhere: he has difficult relationships even with his closest circle, not to mention his rivals and competitors. Even those for whom he felt no animosity sometimes found it difficult to communicate with him. 'Conversations with Ishiwara,' recalled one of his acquaintances, 'often resembled a Zen-style question-and-answer session. In response to the most serious questions asked, he would often slap his palm on his smoothly shaven head, stick out his tongue, or make faces, giving no answer.' And although he could be cheerful and relaxed, his general abstinence meant that he usually had neither the inclination nor the opportunity for the combination of camaraderie and backroom politics so characteristic of restaurant gatherings and so beloved by most Japanese military personnel."
 NW_JAP.582.a: "An interesting man"
 NW_JAP.583.t: "Approval and Criticism of Ishiwara's Ideas"
 NW_JAP.583.d: "Ishiwara's ideas in support of the true independence of Asian states found a response among the progressive members of Prince Konoe's think tank, the Koain, the Council for the Development of Asia, and even Konoe himself. However, for the idea of the East Asian League to be massively accepted in Japan, Ishiwara and his followers must recognize Japan as the leader of Asia. And on the other hand, this becomes a stumbling block in attempts to gain support for the idea of the East Asian League on mainland Asia. No matter how attractive it was outside of Japan, it was based on Ishiwara's assertion that it should become a 'federation of equal and politically independent Asian nations.' For nationalist critics in Japan, such a proposal is dangerously close to promoting the kind of internationalism that Japan has strongly opposed in recent years. Such critics believe that in name and content, this whole idea has a disgusting resemblance to the League of Nations, and, like that organization, it seemed to presuppose the existence of a supranational system above Japan. As such, it raised heretical questions about the supremacy of the kokutai and the position of the emperor. Moreover, in its emphasis on the racial issue and political independence, Ishiwara's proposal, in their opinion, opened up dangerous possibilities for the secession of Taiwan and Korea from Japan. All these arguments became a powerful reason for a flurry of criticism against Ishiwara's plans and the movement that supported him."

 NW_JAP.584.d.a: "Ishiwara had long encountered the arrogant attitude of his colleagues and many Japanese towards other Asians, especially the Chinese. This was particularly evident after the creation of Manchukuo, when the new state turned out to be far from the ideal of 'racial harmony,' but rather resembled European colonies in which the role of Europeans was taken by Ishiwara's comrades in the officer corps of the Imperial Army. To combat this, it was decided to distribute a circular 'To All Officers and Men of the Expeditionary Army' throughout the army as part of an effort to restore moral discipline in the Japanese troops. The circular stated that cruel actions against the civilian population demeaned the dignity of the Japanese army and pointed to the need to ensure 'sincere cooperation between Japan and the Asian peoples.'"

Ishiwara and his circle had already tried to improve this situation, but they met with resistance from other army officers. Now they were able to distribute the circular 'To All Officers and Men of the Expeditionary Army' throughout the army, including to ordinary soldiers.

 NW_JAP.585.d: "Kanji Ishiwara, unexpectedly even for many of his supporters, condemned the government's persecution of political opponents with the help of the secret police and especially emphasized the danger of military intervention in the work of the government. This is doubly unusual to hear from a senior officer, but apparently he was strongly influenced by the difficulties he encountered during the development of his East Asian League Movement, and earlier in Manchukuo, where he saw the reality of when his military colleagues were trusted to run the country."

 NW_JAP.586.t: "The Housing Problem"
 NW_JAP.586.d: "In the new type of society that Ishiwara envisions, housing would, of course, be a crucial factor. His solution was to house people in large, hotel-like buildings, where the family would be the basic unit of social organization, and elderly relatives living in the same building would be a source of emotional support, not a burden. In this sense, Ishiwara believes he has discovered a system of life that, in his opinion, would combine the best aspects of filial piety and individual freedom.\n\n- We can, at least, realize a common destiny that will unite today's Japanese family with the agriculture of tomorrow, giving rise to an ideal that goes beyond blood kinship and leads to a stable economic existence and a spiritual life without conflict, Ishiwara said in one of his speeches on this topic."
 NW_JAP.586.a: "Ishiwara invented mass housing development"
 NW_JAP.587.t: "Problems of Communal Factories"
 NW_JAP.587.d: "Ishiwara's ideas about moving industry to the villages, and their integration with cities, as well as the elimination of giant factories, are faced with a harsh reality that some experts warned about: work in such 'small enterprises' turns out to be not only extremely inefficient, but also to some extent useless. It turned out that the main problem is that it is impossible to achieve the required level of product quality if it is produced not in special large factories, but in separate small rural factories (for example, an attempt to produce steel in rural factories led to the fact that the steel obtained in village blast furnaces fell apart in their hands). There is a shortage of specialized personnel who previously had the opportunity to control everything while being at one factory, as well as equipment. In addition, there were difficulties with logistics: it turned out to be monstrously overloaded and there was a shortage of vehicles, as now it is necessary to transport much more products over long distances between small enterprises scattered at least within one region."
 NW_JAP.587.a: "It seems even geniuses make mistakes"
 NW_JAP.588.t: "Showa Restoration Plan"
 NW_JAP.588.d: "Ishiwara has published his new work, titled 'Showa Restoration Plan.' In it, he took the original concept of the Showa Restoration as the basis for internal reform in Japan and expanded it to include reform in East Asia. Ishiwara argues that the Meiji Restoration was a Japanese restoration, carried out with the aim of overthrowing feudalism and creating a racial state centered on the emperor. The Showa Restoration, although it initially entailed radical changes in Japan, was to become an Asian restoration, uniting all Asian races. This would unite their devotion to a common set of moral values in a racial union to fight for the eradication of two hundred years of humiliation by the West. This struggle, the Final War, would lead to the restoration of peace, to a new unification of all races on the basis of the principle of the 'righteous way.'\n\nIn it, Ishiwara also outlined the essence of his reflections over two decades: his analysis of a protracted and decisive war, his view of battle as a geometric progression, the growing cruelty of the conflict, the clash of East and West, and the apocalyptic prophecy of Nichiren. To this he added several new assumptions. One of them was the assertion that the world had entered a 'second industrial revolution,' made possible by the fantastic achievements of science, especially in the field of electrochemistry (pioneered at the time by the Germans), which would allow the production of unprecedented sources of energy for both industrial production and the production of military weapons. Ishiwara told his audience that such discoveries would allow Asian countries to catch up with and, ultimately, surpass the West in productive and destructive power.\n\nMore important was his new focus on East Asia. The League, which was to be revived as a result of the reforms of the Showa Restoration, transformations aimed at the progress and liberation of all of Asia. Thus, the Showa Restoration included not only political reforms, but also national defense at home, as well as Pan-Asianism abroad. The East Asian League that it was to give rise to was to become a 'federation' of equal states, united to overthrow Western oppression by force of arms. However, the League itself was to be based on moral values, not on coercion. Once Asia defeated the West, its principles of harmony and cooperation, the 'righteous way,' could be extended to the whole world, and the 'eight corners of the world under one roof' could finally become a reality."

 NW_JAP.589.t: "Ishiwara's Promotion"
 NW_JAP.589.d: "Kanji Ishiwara has been transferred to a new position within the General Staff and promoted to the rank of major general. His other supporters have also received new appointments, so that now Ishiwara will not be able to influence the policy of our government so much, but at the same time his skills of strategic thinking will have the opportunity for realization."
 NW_JAP.589.a: "We hope that in his new position he will apply his best qualities and will not interfere"
 NW_JAP.590.t: "Criticism of Mein Kampf"
 NW_JAP.590.d: "Recently, Ishiwara made a new speech in which he criticized the book 'Mein Kampf' by the Nazi ideologue, Adolf Hitler. For many years, a certain cult has developed around the Nazis in Japan; from afar, from the other end of the world, they seem to many to be the most progressive and modern political force, capable of building a great state. Many politicians have adopted their methods of political struggle, and even Ishiwara himself has expressed some admiration for Hitler as the new 'Napoleon of Europe.' However, recently Ishiwara decided to better understand their ideology and expressed doubts about the correctness of their ideas. In particular, he warned against Japan adopting a position of racial purity that would exclude Koreans. Ishiwara argued that Hitler had made a biological mistake in believing that Germans and Jews were different biological species, when in fact they were more like varieties of the same species. In addition, racially pure peoples, such as the tribes of Native Americans, were in practice weak. In contrast, the Japanese, Ishiwara argues, are of 'mixed blood,' and therefore are a strong people."
 NW_JAP.590.a: "An unexpected blow to the cult of the Nazis"
 NW_JAP.591.t: "Ishiwara's Reflections on the Power of Arms" 
 NW_JAP.591.d: "The most important news of recent weeks, the beginning of the atomic age of mankind and the use of the first nuclear bomb, could not but remain without Ishiwara's attention. For some time he pondered, studying the consequences of the nuclear strike, which reached Japan both through open channels and through intelligence. Despite the fact that he himself had long predicted the appearance of this particular type of weapon, even he did not expect what kind of power it would be, and most importantly, what destruction and suffering it would bring. In the weeks that have passed, there is information about many people dying days later from the consequences of the nuclear explosion, radiation sickness.\n\nOn the one hand, according to Ishiwara's ideas, the appearance of a new, more destructive type of weapon should bring the beginning of the Final War closer, but now he began to think more often that it is possible to achieve the victory of the East over the West in other ways, and not just by direct military confrontation with the use of such monstrous new types of weapons."
 NW_JAP.591 .a: "However, this destroys the very basis of his concept of the Final War" 
 NW_JAP.592.t: "Ishiwara's Grave Condition"
 NW_JAP.592.d: "Ishiwara has become even more incapacitated due to a recurrence of a painful internal ailment caused by an old injury received during the Manchurian campaign. His condition has deteriorated so much that he was forced to move to a hospital in Tokyo for surgery and medical care. It is likely that he will no longer be able to perform the duties of prime minister, so he is going to hand over this post to one of his supporters, and after his recovery he will return to the role of spiritual leader of the East Asian League Movement."

 NW_JAP.593.t: "Ishiwara's New Reflections on Agriculture"
 NW_JAP.593.d: "For the few remaining years of his life, bedridden, Ishiwara spends his time in semi-mystical reflections, as well as in spreading his theories of agricultural self-sufficiency among those followers who have gathered in Nishiyama to be with him. In his speech on 'Creating a New Japan,' Ishiwara touched upon the possibilities of shifting Japan's focus from industrialization and from centralized urbanism to decentralized and self-sufficient rural units. In particular, he developed the idea of 'returning to the land,' a concept that was in many ways similar to the ideas of the 'agrarian movement' of the 30s, and in particular the agrarian theorist Gondo Seikei. In Ishiwara's approach, special attention was paid to the resettlement of the population in rural areas, the government's encouragement of small local enterprises, the opening of new lands for cultivation, and the development of new methods of farming, in particular, through the use of yeast fertilizers."
 NW_JAP.593.a: "Yes, these are valuable remarks"
 NW_JAP.594.t: "Ishiwara's New Ideological Positions"
 NW_JAP.594.d: "More than anything else, recent years have been marked by a gradual weakening of Ishiwara's ideas, which were laid down in his concept of the Final War. The other day, he completely switched to a position of pacifism. Ishiwara decided to record his next address on tape, in the format of an interview. In it, he stated:\n\n- We must completely renounce war. We must resolutely avoid issues related to interests and benefits, and judge our national policy solely in the spirit of righteousness. Japan may be devastated because of a possible war, so we must live by completely rejecting war. The nation must gather, like Nichiren at Takenoguchi or Christ on the way to the crucifixion.\n\nTakenoguchi is a place in the city of Kamakura, designated for the execution of the monk Nichiren, the founder of this Buddhist school. It is possible that the spread of this idea undermines the ideas of the East Asian League movement too much, and we should limit its spread, citing Ishiwara's poor health in recent months and the clouding of his mind."
 NW_JAP.594.a: "No, the people must know the truth, and freedom of speech must be preserved, these are Ishiwara's own words"
 NW_JAP.594.b: "Yes, we must limit society from such statements"
 NW_JAP.595.t: "Ishiwara's Last Message"
 NW_JAP.595.d: "Experiencing constant pain from his chronic ailment, Ishiwara struggled all winter and spring of this year. Then, in the summer, a severe cold he caught developed into severe pneumonia. Realizing that his death was near, Ishiwara dictated a message the other day in which he summed up all his reflections of recent years about his country and its future. Ishiwara began by reviewing his point of view that in modern history there was first a transition from absolutism to liberalism, and by this he obviously meant laissez-faire liberalism, and then to a system of state planning, which he called a system of 'control.' Each of these systems represented a higher level of efficiency, with the most effective, in his opinion, being the system of the controlling state, since it arose as a dialectical synthesis of absolutism and liberalism. Probably because of his substantial confusion between the system of economic control and the system of political management, Ishiwara had to make a lot of effort to prove that the idea of planning, which was central to the control state he was talking about, was not identical to totalitarianism, as it had come to be understood in recent times."
 NW_JAP.595.a: "We must spread this message"
 NW_JAP.595.b: "In his dying speeches, Ishiwara is going too far"
 NW_JAP.596.t: "The Dangers of Group Despotism"
 NW_JAP.596.d: "In a note that he attached to his memorandum a few weeks later, Ishiwara emphasized that although Germany, Italy, Japan, and the Soviet Union had embarked on the path of state control, they soon fell victim to 'group despotism,' in which all decisions were made by a few people in the center. But their perversion of the original concept in no way made it invalid or incompatible with democracy or personal freedom, Ishiwara insisted. In fact, he argued, the control system was part of a broad world trend in which the maximum degree of freedom was preserved within a system of general planning. Thus, even democratic states had moved to a control system. As an example, he cited the 'New Deal' program in the United States. In his July memorandum, Ishiwara pointed out that he believed that true liberalism (in the sense of non-interference) no longer existed anywhere, even in the United States."
 NW_JAP.596.a: "These are the right words"
 NW_JAP.596.b: "In the current situation, we cannot allow the spread of such thoughts"
 NW_JAP.597.t: "Regional Specifics"
 NW_JAP.597.d: "Turning to the justification of the concept of the East Asian League, Ishiwara noted that the development of a system of state planning throughout the world must take into account regional differences. Thus, the Japanese system of government would be Asian in ideology and character (an assertion that allowed him to preserve the Asian idea of the 'righteous way' as the fundamental principle of the state). 'The world must develop through cooperation between globalism and regionalism,' Ishiwara stated, and therefore East Asian unity, based on common cultural ties, became a step on the path to world peace. But it was the East Asian League that offered the most practical and innovative plan for the unification of East Asia compared to other competitors, both within Japan and beyond its borders."
 NW_JAP.597.a: "We confirm this in practice"

 NW_JAP.598.t: "The Death of Kanji Ishiwara"
 NW_JAP.598.desc.a: "For the last two weeks, Kanji Ishiwara's pneumonia has become terminal, and his closest followers have gathered around the small house where he was dying. He asked that Buddhist prayers be read for him. Another famous pan-Asianist ideologue, Okawa ShQmei, also arrived when he was informed of Ishiwara's dying condition. It is said that at the end, Ishiwara expressed satisfaction that he was leaving this world at the age of sixty-one, the same age at which Nichiren, the founder of the religious movement that Ishiwara had followed for so many years, died. In Japan, it is traditional to count a person's age as one year older, so at birth he is immediately one year old. Because of this, in the European manner, Ishiwara would only be 60 years old."
 NW_JAP.598.desc.b: "$NW_JAP.598.desc.a$\n\nThe death of Ishiwara has upset the delicate balance in the structure of the East Asian League, as previously it was Ishiwara, even sick and almost incapacitated, who remained the most legitimate leader and the most popular figure of the movement, despite the fact that the post of prime minister has been held by for several years. All decisions were considered to be made with Ishiwara's approval, although recently, due to the deterioration of his health, he has hardly participated in state work, and his closest assistants, secretaries, and friends have begun to play a greater role. The current government, against the backdrop of the death of the legendary general, has decided to resign, and elections for a new leader are taking place in the League, who will probably be the leader of the dominant faction in it."

 NW_JAP.599.t: "The Fall of Ishiwara"
 NW_JAP.599.d.a: "In the last month, Ishiwara's influence has fallen so low that, with the exception of Kawabe Torashiro and one or two other people, few even in the operations department of the General Staff followed his example. As genro Saionji told Prince Konoe, Ishiwara had become simply a 'nuisance' to the Umezu-Terauchi group: 'He is like a candle in the wind, ready to go out at any moment.' The necessary gust of wind was not long in coming. The other day, when Ishiwara's effectiveness was at zero, he was removed from his post in the General Staff. The victory of Sugiyama and Umezu seems complete.\n\nAlthough this is not entirely true. The people who are replacing Ishiwara in his post are also part of the group of moderate officers of the Imperial Army seeking a diplomatic resolution to the conflict that has begun, so it looks more like getting rid of a general who has become too useless and toxic for his entourage."
 NW_JAP.599.d.b: "$NW_JAP.599.d.a$\n\nHis new appointment was the post of deputy chief of staff of the Kwantung Army in Manchuria. Perhaps he will be able to change something in Manchukuo, as this state clearly does not correspond to the ideal of racial harmony that Colonel Ishiwara himself spoke of in 1932."

 NW_JAP.599.b: "Ishiwara became a victim of his ambitions"
 NW_JAP.600.t: "The Return of Ishiwara"
 NW_JAP.600.d: "Kanji Ishiwara, the man thanks to whom Manchukuo got a chance to be born, returns to his original creation, from whose leadership he was excluded at the very beginning of its formation in 1932. Then he was an insignificant colonel, who, although he managed to gain influence over the headquarters of the Kwantung Army, was nothing more than that. Over the past years, fate has managed to raise him to incredible heights, practically bringing him to the role of the gray cardinal of the Japanese government, but after a series of political failures and the failure of his policy of detente and peace in relations with China, he was dismissed from the General Staff and sent to the post of deputy chief of staff of the Kwantung Army. Now he is in the rank of major general, but his reputation is severely damaged, and his actual position does not have the important tools of control, so he will be severely limited in his ability to bring Manchukuo to the ideal that he was fired up with when he created it several years ago."

 NW_JAP.601.d: "When Ishiwara arrived in Manchuria, his position at the headquarters of the Kwantung Army and his ability to effect any real change had already been weakened by the failure of his local reformist allies. Nevertheless, since his interests were similar and since he treated them with such passion, he eventually re-established contact with this group and made their struggle his own. On an official level, Ishiwara tries to convey his views through a constant stream of memorandums to the command of the Kwantung Army, in which he sharply criticizes the current situation in Manchuria and gives energetic recommendations for making clear changes in policy. From these messages, several general themes of Ishiwara's disagreement can be identified. The main ones were the following memorandums: 'Recommendations for defense against a Soviet invasion'; 'Demands for the abolition of the internal leadership of Manchukuo'; 'On the abolition of the internal leadership of Manchukuo'; 'The guiding authority of the commander of the Kwantung Army'; 'Opinion regarding the army's withdrawal from politics.'"

 NW_JAP.603.d: "The situation with Ishiwara eloquently testifies to the surprising tolerance of the Japanese military system for acts of insubordination, as none of these incidents led to Ishiwara's arrest and court-martial. This is all considered a manifestation of the very gekokujo, the spirit of insubordination of juniors to seniors. Be that as it may, Ishiwara's frantic behavior and his connections with 'subversive' reformist elements both in Manchuria and in Japan led to his complete isolation at the headquarters of the Kwantung Army. Despite the departure of some of his direct opponents from the leadership, such as General Tojo, who held the post of Chief of the General Staff of the Kwantung, his successor, General Rensuke Isogai, a former ally of Ishiwara, found it prudent to stay away from him, as did other old friends like Colonel Tadashi Katakura, now working in the Special Services Bureau. Ishiwara's enemies, of course, were caustic in their remarks. One of them, Masahiko Amakasu, now one of the leaders of the Concordia Association, gave Ishiwara his scathing comment, telling him to his face that his continued presence was no longer in the interests of Manchukuo. By today, Ishiwara has become a universal disgrace, as a result of which the Chief of Staff of the Army, Korechika Anami, and concurrently his friend, noted in his diary the other day that the 'Ishiwara problem' was one of his biggest headaches."

 NW_JAP.604.desc.a: "Discouraged by his precarious position in the army, dissatisfied with what he considered Japan's pernicious influence in Asia, and again suffering from a bout of illness, General Ishiwara decided to leave Manchukuo and the Kwantung Army before he was kicked out. The very process by which he tried to do this became the subject of fierce debate. Ishiwara submitted an application to the Ministry of War, where he was told that to be enrolled in the reserve, the matter had to be approved by the Minister of War, but in the meantime he was allowed to return to Japan on sick leave.\n\nHowever, the leadership of the Kwantung Army insists that Ishiwara left it without any permission, that one day he simply got up from his desk and left Manchuria not in military uniform, but in the dark olive uniform of the Concordia Association. Ishiwara's departure caused discontent in the command of the Kwantung Army, and an officer was sent to Tokyo to inform the Minister of War of Ishiwara's behavior. However, neither he nor his deputy made any attempt to summon the troublesome general once he arrived in Tokyo."
 NW_JAP.604.desc.b: "$NW_JAP.604.d.a$\n\nBut General Hideki Tojo, also as Vice Minister, got wind of the matter and, for understandable reasons, was very keen to see Ishiwara broken.

All this will be in anticipation of the coming 'final war.' In Manchuria, the League is just beginning to enjoy the fruits of active support from local Japanese groups scattered throughout the region, hoping to restore previous claims of racial harmony. The commander of the China Expeditionary Army has sent the command of the Kwantung Army a copy of the circular 'To All Officers and Men of the Expeditionary Army' as part of an effort to restore moral discipline in the Japanese occupation forces, hoping to enlist its support for a joint Sino-Manchurian statement of support for the East Asian League."

This program of personal attacks culminated in a speech Ishiwara gave at Kyoto University on the problems of East Asia. Ishiwara told his audience, which included the governor of Kyoto Prefecture:\n\n- The enemy is not the Chinese people, but rather some Japanese.

However, this idea was strongly opposed by General Korechika Anami, the Army Vice Minister, who highly valued Ishiwara's outstanding talent. Anami's behavior changed dramatically from his usual meek demeanor and neutral status, and he said: 'Having General Ishiwara in the reserve is a loss for the army itself. If we force such a talented man into the reserve, it will cause unnecessary friction.' He publicly argued with Tojo at the War Ministry, and they had a heated argument in front of other officers. Anami even relied on his connections with Prince Naruhiko, a member of the imperial family and an army general who is fond of Ishiwara, to try to reverse Tojo's arbitrary personnel changes.

The other day, he was interrogated by several Kempeitai officers at his home. They asked him why he opposed Tojo. Ishiwara replied that it was foolish to think that he, just an old retired soldier with no power or influence, could 'oppose' Tojo, who was both War Minister and Prime Minister of Japan. When the Kempeitai officers insisted that the heart of the problem was that his ideas contradicted Tojo's, Ishiwara retorted:\n\n- That is even more insane. Of course, I have ideas.

However, even without the split, there were too many supporters of dissolution within the Seiyukai; the only faction resisting this outcome is Hatoyama's circle with the old liberals of the party, but they had too little power and even they ultimately agreed to dissolve 'their' Seiyukai, following the Nakajima faction and the neutral faction, which is most actively participating in the dissolution movement."

An unexpected backstab for him was the support for the dissolution movement from the party's 'second-in-commands': the famous orator Ryutaro Nagai and the quiet schemer Tadao Oasu. However, for now, Chuji is holding on and, according to sources close to the party, is negotiating with other pro-parliamentary forces: Ichiro Hatoyama, the social democrats, and independent liberals."

 NW_JAP.618.d: "Once a liberal party, but now led by Ryutaro Nagai and tied by an alliance with the military, the Shinshinto party today announced its self-dissolution at the adventurous hand of its leader. A small group of Shinshinto deputies expressed their protest in a separate address to journalists, but they went unnoticed, as the loud headline that the main liberal parliamentary party had declared its support for the government became the main news of the day."

 NW_JAP.619.d: "As a close aide to Prince Konoe and a former member of Rikken Minseito, Akira Kazami, said: 'Mr. Machida's role is simply to dissolve the Minseito, and if he is going to take on a role beyond that, he must be prepared for new challenges. Simultaneously with the dissolution of the Democratic Party, he must take full responsibility for the party's poor performance so far and resign. There can be no doubt about this.' Despite attempting to resist the party's dissolution, under universal pressure, Machida Chuji today announced the dissolution of the Rikken Minseito."

 NW_JAP.620.d: "The most obvious and expected news related to the dissolution of parties was the statement from the leaders of the Shakai Taishuto from the party's national-socialist faction, who were the main behind-the-scenes actors of the party dissolution movement. They tried to achieve the dissolution of their party faster than anyone else to set an example for others and to show their loyalty to the current government more than anyone else. They were not hindered even by the resistance of the party's founder, the legendary Abe Isoo, and his social-democratic faction. Deputies from his circle, including himself, announced their readiness to create a new party and even told journalists its name - Kinro Kokuminto, or the National Labor Party."

The split at the end of 1935 and the departure of most of its deputies, the loss of major leaders like Seigo Nakano and Akira Kazami - all these were symptoms of the imminent death of this political combination. Today, Adachi decided to jump on the gaining momentum of the one-party movement and easily announced the dissolution of the Kokumin Domei."

At Ishiwara's request, Miyazaki has spent the last six months creating a five-year industrial development plan for Japan, with the knowledge of the director of the South Manchuria Railway, Yosuke Matsuoka, who provided funding for Miyazaki's group.\n\nThe developed plan turned out to be so radical and required such large financial investments that it was initially decided to adopt a scaled-down version for implementation in Manchukuo. To organize this, Miyazaki traveled to Xinjing and held a meeting with General Seishiro Itagaki and Yosuke Matsuoka. In his characteristic enthusiastic manner, Matsuoka approved the plan, and Itagaki already knew its details through their mutual friend, Kanji Ishiwara."

 NW_JAP.626.d: "The most unpleasant news for the public spread through the streets of Tokyo: the resisting leaders of the two main parliamentary parties came under brutal pressure. First, rallies of several thousand participants were held at their headquarters, demanding that the politicians yield to the government and dissolve their parties. After that, the cars of Ichiro Hatoyama and Machida Chuji were attacked by terrorists on their way from home to their headquarters - they were shot at with pistols, but the radicals did not achieve their goal, and both deputies survived. Shortly after, the supporters of the One-Party Movement who had gathered at the rallies near the party offices began to storm, or rather blockade, these headquarters. Attempts to call the police were thwarted by some of the protesters cutting the buildings' telephone wires. After some time, Hatoyama and Chuji surrendered, apparently independently of each other, and released messages to journalists stating that their parties were joining the government's Movement for the Dissolution of Parties."

He then drafted a manifesto and published it in October under the title 'Kingoro Hashimoto's Manifesto' - 'An Outline of the Great Leap Forward to the Great Japanese National System.' The manifesto was structured as follows:\n\n1. Spiritual Leap;\n\n2. Economic Leap;\n\n3. Leap in Foreign Policy;\n\n4. Leap in Armaments (which included the following sub-points: (1) Perspective on national defense in a broad sense; (2) Perspective on winning the first battle; (3) Historical perspective on the changing form of warfare; (4) Perspective on the development of aviation);\n\n5. Leap in Politics.\n\nThus, in the coming days, Hashimoto and his supporters intend to create a new political party. One of them commented that the new party's mission is to 'realize a unified nation and a one-party system with the aim of mobilizing the entire nation,' and that 'this is an attempt to distinguish itself from traditional parliamentary parties.' The concept of 'One Nation, One Party' was apparently influenced by the National Socialist rule in Germany, but it also states that 'we will be loyal and responsible to our great Japanese Emperor,' which led him to further comment that 'Hitler could become a dictator in both name and substance, but in Japan, as long as we recognize the existence of the Emperor, there is no possibility for a dictator to become a dictator.'"

 NW_JAP.629.d: "Early this morning, the founding ceremony of a new party was held at the Meiji Shrine. A group of seven men dressed in dark blue serge uniforms, including Hashimoto, Atsutaro Suyama (a former supporter and deputy of the Social Democratic Party), Shigetsugu Matsunobu (a student of Shumei Okawa), Masayoshi Yabumoto, and Kenichi Okawa (former members of the Japanese National Socialist Party), all of whom had careers in social movements, walked along the main approach to the Meiji Shrine, and Okawa raised the party flag, a white circle on a red background. They lined up in front of the shrine, and Hashimoto, stepping forward, took an oath, saying:\n\n- My lord, Kingoro cannot ignore the current situation of the imperial nation. I hereby create the Great Japan Youth Party and pledge to dedicate myself to supporting the great cause of the Showa Restoration. I pray that the gods grant us their protection.\n\nThe 'White Sun, Red Flag of Sincerity' was named in honor of this and symbolized unity with the Emperor, as a similar banner was used by the imperial army during the Meiji Restoration. The party was named the 'Great Japan Youth Party,' and as the name suggests, it is primarily aimed at young people and is modeled after the Hitler Youth of the German Reich. This went so far as to even borrow the light brown color for the members' uniforms. The stated goal of the party was to teach Japanese youth basic survival skills, first aid, life skills, cultural lessons, traditions, and the basics of handling weapons. The first party congress is also scheduled to take place soon."

This is an important issue due to the role he plays in Manchuria - in fact, all matters of governing Manchukuo, not just our local army, fall to him.\n\nThe army is ready to approve Kenkichi Ueda as a candidate, an old general who lost a leg in an attack by a Korean terrorist in 1932 in Shanghai, and who is not affiliated with any of the existing factions in the army, which may help keep Manchukuo on a more stable course and allow for more influence from Tokyo.\n\nAn alternative option could be General Yoshijiro Umezu, commander of one of the divisions in the North China Army, but he is a representative of the Toseiha faction, which will affect the military's policy within Manchukuo.\n\nAnother option could be General Seishiro Itagaki, who is the deputy chief of staff of the Kwantung Army, but it should be remembered that he is one of the two men responsible for the unauthorized seizure of Manchuria in 1931. This, by the way, also makes him the leader of the Manchurian faction, which, unlike all others, advocates for reducing the Kwantung Army's control over the Manchukuo government and establishing real local self-government."

The assassin turned out to be the most famous and strongest Japanese judoka, Masahiko Kimura, who tried to flee the scene, but since he had to climb down from the tree from which he threw the bomb, it took too long, and he received a large dose of gas, but has so far survived and been hospitalized. The military police have begun a search for suspects, as it is unlikely he could have done this alone; at the very least, he must have obtained this secret military weapon from somewhere.

However, the General Staff, unable to completely abandon its 'infantry first' philosophy due to its rigidity, gave an ambiguous answer: 'aviation is a priority, but ground forces are absolute.'\n\nSugawara was disappointed that the army considered aviation a branch of the military responsible only for field battles, and believed that the navy, which had shifted its focus to aviation, was three years behind the army. When the navy asked him to clarify the details of his inspection in Germany, he officially proposed to the navy to create an independent air force in Japan, combining the army and navy aviation, similar to the Luftwaffe. In response to Sugawara's proposal, the Navy decided to reject his advanced proposal, stating that 'the issue of an independent air force is premature, and the Navy does not support it,' for reasons such as the army's larger size and political influence, which meant that an independent air force would likely be under the army's control, and that they did not want the Navy's aviation to be absorbed by the army's aviation, which was inferior in terms of technology and military tactics."

Exactly what the emperor had feared immediately after the coup happened - the morally broken prime minister would commit suicide. At that time, Okada had agreed to continue leading the government to maintain the previous course, but he lacked the strength to cope with the growing influence of the opponents of liberalization.\n\nThe genro Saionji announced that the time has now come for the formation of a cabinet by his 'successor,' Prince Konoe, whom he had been preparing for this role for many years. Once, immediately after the failed military coup, his name had already surfaced as a possible candidate for forming a cabinet, but at that time Konoe had shied away from this role. Now there is no turning back; the responsibility for stabilizing the political life in the country falls on him."
 NW_JAP.653.a: "We will not forget Mr. Okada's courage"
 NW_JAP.654.t: "The Poverty of Prime Minister Okada"
 NW_JAP.654.d: "Prime Minister Okada continued to live in his residence, now alone, surrounded by a few maids. After his second wife died, he lived in this residence with his murdered secretary, Denzo Matsuo, who was his younger sister's husband.\n\nHe never enriched his own pocket and lived his whole life in relative poverty; there was barely enough money for the servants' salaries and food. On the day of his inauguration as prime minister, he ran out of money, so he could not buy the traditional sake for the journalists gathered at the prime minister's office, so he only handed out ice cubes, saying: 'Use this to cool your favorite drinks.'\n\nThe top hat he wore at the inauguration ceremony was also borrowed from his son-in-law, Hisatsune Sakomizu, who also took up the post of prime minister's secretary. He had trouble choosing clothes to wear for holidays or other occasions. In fact, during most of Okada's public appearances, he is dressed in his dark blue jacket or casual kimono."
 NW_JAP.654.a: "This is an extremely honest man"
 NW_JAP.655.t: "Negotiations with the Navy"
 NW_JAP.655.d: "The Treaty Faction was practically purged from the Imperial Navy in 1935 during the so-called 'Osumi Purge,' named after the then Minister of the Navy, who himself did not belong to either of the two factions but yielded to the pressure of the Fleet Faction and got rid of their opponents. In addition, he was later tainted by his neutral support for the military conspirators of February 26, which cost him his post. All this ultimately led Japan to withdraw from the London Naval Treaty, but most importantly, the navy lost valuable personnel who were also opponents of a war with the USA and Britain. Okada himself is a prime example of the Treaty Faction, and now, to strengthen his position, he wants to bring his comrades back into service.\n\nA major role in the navy's command is played by the imperial prince Fushimi, who is a supporter of the Fleet Faction and on whose initiative the purges were carried out. However, at that time, this was due to the fierce opposition to the continuation of the London Treaty, and since we have now withdrawn from it, we should perhaps hold negotiations with the naval leaders so that the return of representatives of the Treaty Faction does not look like a conspiracy behind the backs of other naval officers."
 NW_JAP.655.a: "Yes, let's negotiate, convince them we won't return to the treaty, and everything will be fine"
 NW_JAP.655.b: "We must act tough"
 NW_JAP.656.t: "Collapse of the Shakai Taishuto"
 NW_JAP.656.d: "The national-socialist faction of the Shakai Taishuto has announced that their alliance with the social-democratic faction of the socialist movement can no longer be maintained due to the radical divergence of views of these political groups. They are leaving the Shakai Taishuto and will soon create their own new national-socialist party."
 NW_JAP.656.a: "It seems they will have problems in the upcoming elections" 
 NW_JAP.657.t: "Disintegration of the Shakai Taishuto"
 NW_JAP.657.d: "The social-democratic faction of the Shakai Taishuto has announced that their alliance with the national-socialist faction of the socialist movement can no longer be maintained due to the radical divergence of views of these political groups. They are leaving the Shakai Taishuto and will soon create their own new social-democratic party."
 NW_JAP.657.a: "It seems they will have problems in the upcoming elections"
 NW_JAP.658.t: "Merging with Parliamentary Parties"
 NW_JAP.658.d.a: "In our parliament, besides the major parties, there are several small parties of one or more people. There are especially many such parties in the national-socialist camp; besides the faction within our party, politicians of this wing have created many small associations, factions, and coalitions over the last decade, constantly either breaking up or merging again. We can offer them to join our party."
 NW_JAP.658.d.b: "$NW_JAP.658.d.a$\n\nThere are also politicians in parliament who are more left-wing than in our party - also single independent deputies, or one or two representatives of workers' parties of the left wing of the social-democratic movement. We can also offer them to join us to strengthen the overall left-wing government."
 NW_JAP.658.a: "We will offer this to the national-socialists"
 NW_JAP.658.b: "We will offer this to all left-wing parties"
 NW_JAP.658.c: "We will offer this only to the workers' factions"
 NW_JAP.659.t: "Abe Isoo Resigns His Parliamentary Mandate"
 NW_JAP.659.d: "One of the oldest representatives of parliamentary politics, the patriarch of the left-wing movement in Japan, deputy Abe Isoo, is resigning his powers due to his advanced age. The conflicts of recent months, in  which he became embroiled, have had a negative effect on his mood, and he has decided that he no longer wishes to participate in politics. It is hard to say whether he would have stayed if the political parties had not been dissolved, as he is already 75 years old. Rather, this step has accelerated his departure from politics."
 NW_JAP.659.a: "Goodbye, Mr. Abe"
 NW_JAP.660.t: "Abe Isoo Leaves Politics"
 NW_JAP.660.d: "One of the oldest representatives of parliamentary politics, the patriarch of the left-wing movement in Japan, deputy Abe Isoo, is resigning his powers due to his advanced age. Now the main socialist party, the Shakai Taishuto, of which he is the founder, will have to choose a new leader who can also maintain the balance between its factions. Most likely, it will also be a representative of its social-democratic wing, as Abe himself was." 
 NW_JAP.660.a: "Tetsu Katayama will continue his work"

 NW_JAP.660.c: "Marquis Tokugawa will be a good support for our party"
 NW_JAP.661.t: "Nobusuke Kishi Joins the Party"
 NW_JAP.661.d: "One of the leaders of the reformist bureaucrats, Nobusuke Kishi, has expressed his willingness to join our party and participate in the upcoming parliamentary elections to take a deputy's seat. Perhaps this cooperation will strengthen the position of our party as a whole, as Kishi has a wide range of acquaintances in various spheres of life."
 NW_JAP.661.a: "Yes, we will accept him"
 NW_JAP.661.b: "No, we'd rather remain independent"
 NW_JAP.662.t: "Unification of Right-Wing Forces"
 NW_JAP.662.d: "The first socialist cabinet was a cold shower for all other parliamentary parties, especially for the old giants Seiyukai and Minseito. The right-wing forces began to think about how to prepare for the next parliamentary elections to overthrow what they saw as the inevitably temporary 'first and last' socialist cabinet. The answer to this task was the idea of uniting the democratic (and not only) right-wing forces into a single party, repeating the path of the ruling party itself, which arose from the unification of various left-wing and near-left movements. This idea was led by Ichiro Hatoyama, once the head of one of the factions of the Rikken Seiyukai, and now the 'first among equals' in the new Dokokai party. Almost all the remnants and heirs of the Seiyukai and Minseito have poured into it, so the new party also has a special committee consisting of all the leaders of the former parties, strictly controlling Hatoyama. It includes Kuhara, Nakajima, Machida Chuji, and several other less-known figures. Despite the apparent soundness of this decision, pessimistic sentiments prevail in the committee, and none of its members believe in the viability of the Dokokai."
 NW_JAP.662.a: "We will be watching"
 NW_JAP.663.t: "New Sources of Support"
 NW_JAP.663.d: "Despite the seeming antagonism between the old structures of government and the country's first socialist government, the former 'power players' have managed to adapt to the new rules of the game and the democratic system. In response to how the army and the national socialist faction have achieved a kind of political symbiosis, the social-democratic faction has received unexpected support from officials of the Imperial Court and the leadership of the zaibatsu. Feeling such powerful support and the legitimacy of their ideas, this will allow the social democrats to restore their position in the party, which had previously been sagging due to the dominance of the totalitarian concepts of the national socialists. It is not surprising that the zaibatsu have also joined this game; the reforms of the social democrats are the 'lesser of two evils' in the current political situation, as the most radical ideas of the national socialists involve establishing direct control over large-scale industry. The only force among the 'elite groups' that has so far remained neutral is the Imperial Navy. It has not found any interest in supporting the ruling party in principle, although it is believed that they did conduct some negotiations with the social democrats to act in spite of the army and maintain a balance with it."
 NW_JAP.663.a: "The ruling party is firmly embedding itself in the state apparatus"
 NW_JAP.663.b: "We need to convince the navy to become our patrons in exchange for lobbying their interests"
 NW_JAP.664.t: "Similarity of Ideologies"
 NW_JAP.664.d: "The progenitor of the ruling party, the Shakai Minshuto (or Social Democratic Party), was the first political force in parliament to support the Kuomintang in China and the three principles of Sun Yat-sen. As early as May 1927, they sent a delegation to meet with Chiang Kai-shek, after which a solidarity agreement was signed between the Kuomintang and the Shakai Minshuto. With the socialists coming to power in Japan, this cooperation was renewed with new vigor. Moreover, many analysts point out a surprising similarity between some of the provisions of Sun Yat-sen's ideology and that of the Japanese socialists, especially the national socialist faction. The leaders of the countries have suggested that this is because our peoples are linked by Pan-Asianism and therefore, despite the existence of unique national systems in Japan and China, we are closer to each other than to the European states of the West."
 NW_JAP.664.a: "We must continue this cooperation"
 NW_JAP.665.t: "Social Housing"
 NW_JAP.665.d: "The main concern of the socialist party has always been to improve the welfare of the masses, especially the workers in the cities, which have been massively flooded in recent decades. In this regard, there was an urgent need to increase housing space, and as early as 1924, after the Great Kanto Earthquake, an experiment was conducted in Tokyo with the construction by municipal authorities of a complex of modern houses with cheap rent. In addition, the houses are distinguished by their appearance - they are built in the constructivist style that appeared in the 20s in Germany and the Soviet Union. One of these houses is also home to Abe Isoo, the leader and founder of the ruling party. Since the experiment was recognized as successful, we must extend it to the national level, as the problem of urban overpopulation arises not only in the capital region."
 NW_JAP.665.a: "This will allow the working class to live in comfortable conditions" 
 NW_JAP.666.t: "Opposition to the Party's Radicalism"
 NW_JAP.666.d: "Against the backdrop of the strengthening positions of the national socialists within the government and their loud rhetoric in parliament, the old opposition parties have begun to receive more and more support during their speeches criticizing the most radical ideas of the ruling party. Unexpectedly, even those members of the Seiyukai and Minseito who had previously not shied away from contacts with the military began to express their dissatisfaction and concern about the socialists' flirtation with the Imperial Army on many issues. This poses a threat due to the possible loss of the party's popularity in the next elections, and even in the adoption of new bills within the current composition of parliament."
 NW_JAP.666.a: "How quickly they stopped liking the military"
 NW_JAP.667.t: "New Art"
 NW_JAP.667.d: "Cinema is the most modern and groundbreaking art form, but due to the cost of film production, for a long time creative teams could not gain full control over their work, as producers constantly interfered, demanding to reduce the cost and time of film production. However, with the introduction of new legislation and government funding, directors have had the opportunity to release much higher quality and more polished pictures. One of these young innovators was the 30-year-old Akira Kurosawa, who only in February 1936 received the position of assistant director, but thanks to his abilities quickly rose to the main position on the set. His touching works about the lives of ordinary people, criticizing large capitalists and emphasizing the importance of peasants and ordinary city dwellers, have had wide success throughout the Empire.\n\nIn addition, a separate experiment is being conducted with the support of creating our own animation against the backdrop of the successes of American animators such as Walt Disney. The popularity of his color sound cartoons in our country irritates some particularly patriotic people, but this only speaks to the quality of his work. Previously, Japanese animators could not compete with the American giants, as they had to save money severely in the production of their pictures, but now they have the support of the government, and thanks to it, we will be able to create our own popular animation."
 NW_JAP.667.a: "One day our films and animation will win the hearts of Americans too"
 NW_JAP.668.t: "Support for Sports"
 NW_JAP.668.d: "The party leader, Abe Isoo, is called the 'father of Japanese baseball,' because during his studies in America, he became addicted to this sport and, believing that 'knowledge is formed through study, and character through sport,' Abe dedicated himself to the spread and development of baseball, which had only recently appeared in Japan. In 1901, he became the first manager of the Waseda University baseball team and led the team on the first-ever overseas tour in the history of Japanese baseball, bringing with him numerous techniques and training methods used in America, the homeland of baseball. Abe and his team did not keep these secrets within the Waseda team, but instead spread them throughout Japan through books and instructions. This laid the foundation for the development of baseball techniques in Japan. Abe also founded the Dai Nippon Taiiku Kyokai (Great Japan Amateur Sports Association) along with Kano Jigoro and others. In 1930, he became the first president of the Big Six Tokyo baseball league (he resigned in 1932 when the Waseda University baseball club withdrew from the league). It was to be expected that the party he founded would actively invest in the development of sports, and so it happened: recently, a project to build stadiums has been launched in almost every prefecture, and not only for baseball, and additional sports classes with a diverse choice of disciplines are being introduced in schools."
 NW_JAP.668.a: "This is how we will build a healthy and strong-willed nation"

 NW_JAP.670.t: "Usurpation of Power"
 NW_JAP.670.d.a: "Today, the Shakai Taishuto party announced at a regular session of the House of Representatives the introduction of a state of emergency. The parliament building was taken under guard by detachments of young fighters of Kingoro Hashimoto, and the editorial offices of independent parties and newspapers were closed. The leaders of the parties were forced to dissolve their parties, although they were allowed to keep their seats in parliament. The army effectively supported the coup d'etat, if it was not the initiator of this conspiracy."
 NW_JAP.670.d.b: "Today, the Kakushin Shinto party announced at a regular session of the House of Representatives the introduction of a state of emergency. The parliament building was taken under guard by detachments of young fighters of Kingoro Hashimoto, and the editorial offices of independent parties and newspapers were closed. The leaders of the parties were forced to dissolve their parties, although they were allowed to keep their seats in parliament.

 NW_JAP.671 .t: "Proposal to Partition China"
 NW_JAP.671.d: "The Japanese government is offering us a non-aggression pact with a secret clause concerning the division of China into spheres of influence. This is very unexpected on their part, as the Japanese Empire has always proclaimed its staunch anti-communism, and now they are ready to conclude a non-aggression pact right away. However, this is explained by the new parliamentary socialist government of the country, whose ideologues allow for coexistence with our country. In this way, they want to achieve control over the spread of communism in Asia."
 NW_JAP.671.a: "This is an interesting proposal"
 NW_JAP.671.b: "We will not negotiate with imperialists"
 NW_JAP.672.t: "Refusal of the Soviet Representatives"
 NW_JAP.672.d: "The Soviet government has refused to consider the possibility of concluding a non-aggression pact with our state, not to mention the secret annexes to it. Thus, they have once again proved their aggressiveness towards us."

 NW_JAP.673.t: "Election of a New President of the Ruling Party"
 NW_JAP.673.desc: "Due to his health, Machida Chuji is no longer able to perform the duties of party president, nor to be the head of the cabinet - especially since he has held this role for several years, and has been president since the end of 1934. He managed, in cooperation with the emperor's liberal circle, to restore the rule of party cabinets, but now it is time to give way to his successor. The party's top leadership must decide who will become the new party president."
 NW_JAP.673.a: "The staunch liberal and opponent of the military, Saito Takao"
 NW_JAP.673.b: "The former general and supporter of parliamentarism, Kazushige Ugaki" 
 NW_JAP.673.c: "The anti-imperialist, orator, and supporter of the military, Ryutaro Nagai"

 NW_JAP.674.d.a: "Due to his health, Machida Chuji is no longer able to perform the duties of president of Rikken Minseito, especially since he has held this role since the end of 1934. In this regard, he is resigning as president, retaining his deputy's seat, and the party leadership is meanwhile electing a new leader of Minseito, who is Ryutaro Nagai." 
 NW_JAP.674.d.b: "Due to his health, Machida Chuji is no longer able to perform the duties of president of Rikken Minseito, especially since he has held this role since the end of 1934.

 NW_JAP.674.a: "Machida did everything he could in his position"
 NW_JAP.676.t: "The Army Secretly Supports Tohokai"
 NW_JAP.676.d: "A group of deputies from the Tohokai party visited the location of one of the army units in Manchuria. Apparently, this was done at the instigation of both the party leader, Seigo Nakano, who often went on such trips himself to get 'field reports,' and with the support of the army leadership, which is now in the hands of his friend, the leader of the Manchurian faction, Kanji Ishiwara. There are also rumors that the army has begun to secretly allocate funding from its funds for the Tohokai party against the backdrop of the return of party cabinets, in order to strengthen the influence of 'their people' in the next elections."
 NW_JAP.676.a: "They are twisting and turning as much as they can to get to power" 
 NW_JAP.677.t: "Confirmation of Rikken Seiyukai's Previous Ties"
 NW_JAP.677.d: "It has become known that the army leaders, feeling that they cannot directly take power in the country, have decided to return to the 'new old' strategy of political participation - developing ties with convenient parliamentary parties. The Rikken Seiyukai, led by the owner of an aviation corporation, Chikuhei Nakajima, has finally become such a party. The party promotes pro-war populist slogans and, according to some information, receives funding from the army. On the other hand, why would a party associated with several zaibatsu take additional money from the generals."
 NW_JAP.677.a: "This takes us back 10 years"
 NW_JAP.678.t: "Ties between the Army and Shakai Taishuto"
 NW_JAP.678.d: "Starting with the publication of the 'Army Pamphlet' in 1934, some deputies of the Shakai Taishuto party began to openly support the army in its aspirations to take power in the country. With each year, the degree of contact between these two initially seemingly distant forces began to intensify, so today it is not even surprising that the army openly supports this party. Perhaps the most important support that the Shakai Taishuto receives from them is secret funding, which is reported in the newspapers of the left's rivals."
 NW_JAP.678.a: "Their ideas have indeed become similar"
 NW_JAP.679.t: "Strengthening of the One-Party Movement"
 NW_JAP.679.d: "The One-Party Movement is gaining momentum as the next parliamentary elections approach. Thanks to the fact that the Kakushin Shinto was headed by Prince Konoe himself, a figure popular among all strata of society, this party is gaining great popularity among the population."
 NW_JAP.679.a: "A tough opponent"
 NW_JAP.680.t: "Kuhara Headed the One-Party Movement"
 NW_JAP.680.d: "The president of the original Rikken Seiyukai party, Fusanosuke Kuhara, during another conversation with journalists, made statements that he supports the One-Party Movement and even heads it in the current circumstances. It is hard to say whether this is good for us or not, as perhaps if this 'role' were taken by some other, less controversial figure, the Movement itself would have gained a larger scale."
 NW_JAP.680.a: "It's good that Kuhara is the one leading them"
 NW_JAP.681.t: "Kakushin Shinto Receives Support from the One-Party Movement" 
 NW_JAP.681.d: "The New Innovation Party has successfully picked up the ideas of the One-Party Movement, and at the moment these two populist currents have successfully united to achieve a common goal - victory in the upcoming parliamentary elections. In general, this proves the correctness of those observers who spoke of the decline in popularity of the largest parliamentary parties against the backdrop of various corruption scandals."
 NW_JAP.681.a: "A difficult situation"
 NW_JAP.682.t: "Tohokai Receives Support from Supporters of the One-Party Movement"
 NW_JAP.682.d: "Seigo Nakano still managed to skillfully use the One-Party Movement, having agreed with its leaders to support his party in the upcoming parliamentary elections. This will probably allow Nakano to dramatically improve the position of his faction and pave the way for the long-awaited premiership. Once Nakano was part of the Rikken Minseito, but now he has possibly become one of the main rivals of his original party."
 NW_JAP.682.a: "However, Nakano couldn't get along in the Kokumin Domei party either"
 NW_JAP.683.t: "Loss of Trust in Rikken Minseito"
 NW_JAP.683.d: "Our bet on excluding pro-war agitation against the backdrop of hostilities has obviously not had the best effect on the support for our party, and now we need to urgently take measures to restore our popularity."
 NW_JAP.683.a: "Yes, in such a situation, this is really not what people want to hear" 
 NW_JAP.684.t: "Ryutaro's Approach is Approved"
 NW_JAP.684.d: "Ryutaro's bet on the party's pro-war agitation has had its success - against the backdrop of military operations, this has indeed gained popularity among the people. It is worth noting that this is still playing with fire, but he who does not risk does not drink champagne."
 NW_JAP.684.a: "We will continue to move in this direction"
 NW_JAP.685.t: "Exclusion of Nakajima"
 NW_JAP.685.d: "Nakajima's faction has long hindered the stable work of the party. It has long personally prevented Hatoyama from leading the party. Now that Hatoyama's authority as the winner of the parliamentary elections is indisputable, he can realize his long-standing plan to get rid of Nakajima and his supporters. This will lead to the loss of deputies from the party in the Diet, but during the existence of his government, he will be able to recover this loss."
 NW_JAP.685.a: "Goodbye, Mr. Nakajima"
 NW_JAP.686.t: "Carefree Papa"
 NW_JAP.686.d: "Shortly after the Great Kanto Earthquake, the editor-in-chief of the Hochi Shimbun thought about publishing a cheerful comic strip in his newspaper and chose the work of a budding cartoonist, Yutaka Aso, who had the idea for an eight-panel comic 'Carefree Papa' about an unemployed man, Nonkin Tosan, who struggles to find a job, sometimes working as a policeman, actor, or announcer, but always returning to his life of poverty. The prototype for the idea was the extremely popular American comic strip 'Bringing Up Father,' which was published by the Asahi newspaper, and at first, the young artist refused to even try to publish his work, as he believed it was impossible to compete with such a famous comic, but in the end, it was the series about Nonkin-san that became a bestseller and surpassed its American progenitor in popularity - so much so that several short animated films were even made about him and a large-scale release of advertising and goods under the 'Carefree Papa' brand began. A new term even arose: men with a carefree demeanor began to be called 'nontu.'\n\nWith the growing fame of Prime Minister Machida Chuji, more and more people began to talk about the striking external resemblance of the head of the cabinet to the main character of the comic, but no one should be surprised -Chuji was the president of the Hochi Shimbun newspaper when it began publishing this comic, so perhaps the artist had a direct image for inspiration. Now, following the favorite habit of the Japanese people, the prime minister has been nicknamed Nonkin Tosan, or Carefree Papa."
 NW_JAP.686.a: "The Carefree Premier"
 NW_JAP.687.t: "Ero-guro-nansensu"
 NW_JAP.687.d: "After the start of the Great Depression, a cultural movement emerged in the cities, taking its name from the Anglo-Japanese words 'erotic,' 'grotesque,' and 'nonsense.' Since then, there has been a boom in books, magazines, newspaper articles, and music with erotic, grotesque, and absurd themes, published in large quantities by newspapers and publishing houses. Chief editors, explaining the reasons for agreeing to publish these materials, state that they are trying to help people forget about the problems of daily life and politics, which since 1931 have taken over the front pages of newspapers and which people have grown tired of. On the other hand, some suggest that this was facilitated by the publication in Japan of the complete works of Sigmund Freud on the eve of the Great Depression, but other analysts see the origins of 'ero-guro-nansensu' in the Japanese culture of previous centuries."
 NW_JAP.687.a: "This is another example of moral decline"
 NW_JAP.688.t: "The Pink Dispute"
 NW_JAP.688.d: "Against the backdrop of the strengthening left-wing movement in those years, the Ministry of Home Affairs did not interfere with the spread of such life trends, claiming that 'eroticism is better than terrorism' and 'if you're going to be painted red, it's better to be pink.' One of the striking examples of this perversion was the 'pink dispute,' a labor conflict that arose in 1933 between the female troupe of the Shochiku Girls' Revue and their employer, the Shochiku Musical Theatre company, which tried to cut some musicians and reduce the salaries of the rest. The central figure and leader of the girls' strike was the 18-year-old actress Takiko Mizunoe, who, along with 60 other girls, organized a strike against their management. Despite a brief arrest, they managed to defend their demands, and it is believed that public support, thanks to newspapers that eagerly printed news about the ongoing conflict, played a special role."
 NW_JAP.688.a: "Overall, this is an effective way to pervert the left-wing idea."
 NW_JAP.689.t: "Ero-Pop"
 NW_JAP.689.d: "Also during this period, a music genre known as 'Nee Kouta' became popular. This boom began with the 1929 song 'Aishite Chodai' ('Love Me, Please') by singer Chiyako Sato, which sings: 'Hey, hey, please love me.' Sato became the first singer to record her songs on records. Due to its provocative lyrics, this genre is also called 'ero-kayo' ('erotic pop'). In the early years, there were no laws regulating audio recordings, so music became an active channel for spreading eroticism. However, in 1934, the publishing legislation was revised, giving the government ways to control this market as well. The song 'Wasurecha Iya yo' by Hamako Watanabe, released in March of that year, became particularly popular, possibly against the backdrop of the Sada Abe scandal. Audio records of this song are currently being prepared for release, and it is possible that we should ban this song as extremely erotic."
 NW_JAP.689.a: "We must stop this decadence."
 NW_JAP.689.b: "Let them read and listen to pink rather than red."
 NW_JAP.690.t: "Underground Literature"
 NW_JAP.690.d: "With the adoption of the Universal Manhood Suffrage Act and the flourishing of Taisho democracy, the publisher Kaizosha began to publish 'enpon'—books collecting contemporary Japanese literature sold for one yen to compensate for falling magazine sales. Soon, not only small and medium-sized but also large publishers followed their example, publishing cheap and accessible literature in the ero-guro-nansensu style in the enpon format. The liberal atmosphere of the time contributed to the development of a rebellious mood in the publishing industry, which ignored the censorship and bans imposed on their books. As usual, censorship was strict, and some publishers still practiced self-censorship, but some companies circumvented the law in various ways; for example, some attached a 'Table of Omitted Words' to their books so that the reader would understand what was being censored.\n\nTheoretically, a book banned by censorship could not enter the market. Nevertheless, many such books managed to bypass the authorities in various ways. 'Ero-guro-nansensu' literature acquired a reputation as 'underground' because it was distributed through secret book-selling clubs. One method of bypassing censorship was to conduct 'guerrilla sales,' where the released books were almost completely sold out before being submitted to the Ministry of Home Affairs for inspection. A few copies of the books were specially kept for confiscation if the Ministry of Home Affairs deemed them unsuitable for publication. Thanks to police agents, we know that among the members of the book-selling clubs that distributed these works is the president of the Tokyo Bar Association, Kiyosaku Toyohara, as well as many other intellectuals of our time. To call such books 'underground' would be an exaggeration, as the scale of these operations was quite large.\n\nLarge publishing companies also engaged in guerrilla releases during this period. For example, in 1932, the company Heibonsha published an appendix to the 'Edogawa Ranpo ZenshQ' titled 'Hanzai Zukan,' which was immediately banned from sale for 'corrupting public morals.' The boom in the mass media of 'ero guro nansensu' inspired Heibonsha and other major publishers, such as Shinchosha, to release a large amount of banned content. It is possible that in the current political climate, we should keep a closer eye on the spread of such things."
 NW_JAP.690.a: "Alright, we'll leave this outlet for the people."
 NW_JAP.690.b: "We must put a stop to these attempts."
 NW_JAP.691.t: "A Split in the Rikken Minseito"
 NW_JAP.691.d: "The Rikken Minseito seemed almost an unbreakable monolith compared to its main rival, the Rikken SeiyQkai, where factional disputes were hardly possible. However, a series of recent setbacks for the party (such as losing the general election), as well as the personal rivalry between the two party leaders, Machida ChQji and RyQtaro Nagai, for the leadership position and, most importantly, for ideological dominance, have brought the Minseito to its current state. Officially, neither faction has made any statements after the recent party meeting, but it was held in a very heated manner, and it can be said that the party is on the brink of an abyss."
 NW_JAP.691.a: "Perhaps this has its beneficiaries."
 NW_JAP.692.t: "ChQji Resigns as Minseito Leader"
 NW_JAP.692.d: "Machida ChQji turned out not to be as good a politician as it seemed during the period of national unity cabinets. However, as soon as he was entrusted with forming a government, the truth came out—he failed to lead the party to victory in the next election, which greatly damaged his intra-party image. In the end, understanding his responsibility for the failure, he decided not to cling to his post but to leave it voluntarily. Elections for a new leader were immediately announced, in which RyQtaro Nagai, his protege and the Minseito's general secretary, naturally won. Nagai is distinguished by his good oratorical skills, the art of intrigue, and ambitious foreign policy ideas."
 NW_JAP.692.a: "RyQtaro may prove to be a more formidable opponent than his predecessor."
 NW_JAP.693.t: "ChQji's Faction Leaves the Shinshinto"
 NW_JAP.693.d: "The Rikken Minseito seemed to be at the peak of its greatness and influence, but the personal ambitions of its two leaders began to have a negative effect—RyQtaro Nagai's project to merge parties close to the Minseito into a new single organization did not yield the promised result. One could even say the opposite; in the elections, it led to a monstrous loss of votes for the new Shinshinto party, as old party supporters decided they could no longer support this party, and it failed to attract new ones, or gained too few. However, RyQtaro did not decide to admit his mistakes and did not resign, as was demanded by deputies close to Machida ChQji. As a result, the last party meeting of the Shinshinto ended with ChQji's faction leaving the new party. He gave no other messages or comments on this matter—apparently, what happened was a surprise to him, and he has not yet decided what to do next."
 NW_JAP.693.a: "This is our chance to increase our number of deputies; we need to talk to ChQji."
 NW_JAP.694.t: "Hatoyama's Son's Wedding"
 NW_JAP.694.d: "Today in Tokyo, at the Imperial Hotel, one of the most lavish events of recent years took place, especially considering the current harsh circumstances, attended by many of the country's most noble and wealthy people. It was the wedding of Prime Minister Hatoyama's son, lichiro Hatoyama. He married Yasuko Ishibashi, the daughter of the owner of the Bridgestone Corporation, which produces tires. Despite rumors of the arranged nature of this wedding, the newlyweds looked happy, and indeed, lichiro and Yasuko met on their own while studying in high school a few years ago."
 NW_JAP.694.a: "Still, it seems this wedding will greatly help both families."

 NW_JAP.695.d: "...the Shinshinto."
 NW_JAP.696.t: "Rikken SeiyQkai Presidential Election"
 NW_JAP.696.d: "Hatoyama has served as party president for more than two terms, and so it is time for him to resign to maintain the traditional two-term rule for this position. This will allow the new leader of the Rikken SeiyQkai to take the post of Prime Minister after the upcoming elections. Several people are contenders for this role, primarily two of Hatoyama's closest supporters who have backed him for over 15 years. On the other hand, there is Hitoshi Ashida, a coalition candidate from Hatoyama's intra-party opponents, yet no less a staunch opponent of the military (and perhaps even more so) than Hatoyama himself."
 NW_JAP.696.a: "Ichiro Kono will continue Hatoyama's work."
 NW_JAP.696.b: "Banboku Ono will continue Hatoyama's work."

 NW_JAP.697.b: "The Shakai TaishQto."
 NW_JAP.698.t: "Rikken SeiyQkai Presidential Election"
 NW_JAP.698.d: "To some extent, Chikuhei Nakajima entered the race for the presidency of the Rikken SeiyQkai not of his own will, but at the call of a large number of party members who expressed dissatisfaction with the figures of Suzuki and Hatoyama. They needed a unifying leader capable of challenging the old leadership. Now Nakajima wishes to leave his post, handing over the party leadership to someone else. In any case, the party's financial flows will remain predominantly in his hands."
 NW_JAP.698.a: "The party's rising star, Naka Funada."
 NW_JAP.698.b: "The ambitious representative of the reform bureaucrats, Nobusuke Kishi."
 NW_JAP.698.c: "It's better to stay for another term."
 NW_JAP.699.t: "The One-and-a-Half Party System"
 NW_JAP.699.d: "In the recent parliamentary elections, Chikuhei Nakajima's Rikken SeiyQkai party won again, with a significant majority of deputies. Thanks to the system of financing candidates favorable to the party, built by Nakajima, as well as skillful work with the military, support from the Veterans' Association, and corresponding agitation, the SeiyQkai seems to have formed a new parliamentary era, already dubbed by journalists as the 'one-and-a-half party system,' in which one dominant party retains power, while others cannot gain enough popularity to form a cabinet. Other intra-elite groups, such as the reform bureaucrats, have also found their place in the SeiyQkai, occupying some leadership positions and government seats."
 NW_JAP.699.a: "Let's see how effective this system will be."

 NW_JAP.700.c: "The Rikken Minseito."
 NW_JAP.702.t: "The Murdered Genius" 
 NW_JAP.702.d: "Young officers viewed political leaders such as Hamaguchi Osachi, Inoue Junnosuke, Shidehara Kijuro, and Takahashi Korekiyo as men who put the interests of capitalist entrepreneurs and their own political parties above the needs of national unity and strength, as well as the economic well-being of the population. When Finance Minister Takahashi declared on November 27, 1935, in a widely publicized speech: 'If the military continues to unreasonably insist on increasing budgets, I think they will lose the trust of the people,' he signed his own death warrant.\n\nThe military assassins of February 26 rejected the idea that a finance minister, who they believed was responsible only to big business and party politicians, and not to the emperor and the nation, could think that the people trusted him more than the army. In fact, the rebel officers went so far as to blame Takahashi for urban unemployment and rural poverty at the very time his policies created full employment in the cities and led to a rise in the real value of agricultural products. Takahashi was considered by them to be anti-emperor, although, ironically, Takahashi's seaside villa in Hayama was next to the emperor's villa, and on weekends the finance minister often visited Hirohito to inform him on economic matters.\n\nBefore our eyes, what the conservatives, the military, and various conspirators feared is happening—Takahashi managed, before his assassination, to lay the foundations for the revival of the Japanese economy and the beginning of mass prosperity. The latest work of the prominent British economist John Maynard Keynes theoretically confirms Takahashi's practical actions as finance minister—the Japanese economy recovered thanks to his skillful leadership, not the seizure of Manchuria and the exploitation of its economy, as some critics of the minister claimed. Now our task is to clear the reputation of the great murdered minister and remind the people of who is behind the modern prosperity of the Japanese Empire, discrediting those who so fiercely attacked Takahashi all these years."
 NW_JAP.702.a: "Takahashi was killed, but he prepared those who will continue his work." 
 NW_JAP.703.t: "The Need for Imperial Intervention"
 NW_JAP.703.d: "The last genro, Saionji, was always aware of his status as a descendant of the Fujiwara clan and, moreover, thanks to his close ties with the imperial family from a young age, he had a strong sense of 'protecting and preserving the imperial family,' which shaped his political position. For a long time, he continued to oppose the direct rule of the emperor, whose absolute power meant that mistakes were unacceptable. This became evident when, after Prime Minister Tanaka Giichi was reprimanded by Emperor Showa for the assassination of the Manchurian warlord Zhang Zuolin in 1928, and the cabinet resigned—Saionji opposed the emperor's reprimand, citing the consequences of the reprimand as a pretext for deposing the emperor. Some also attribute Saionji's influence in persuading Emperor Showa that 'as a constitutional monarch, I will not oppose the decisions of my subjects.' Ironically, this same position causes discontent among nationalists and reformers, who, on the contrary, wish for the monarch to take a greater part in political decisions. Saionji always tried to prevent the emperor's direct intervention in politics, which would weaken his position. For this reason, he often expressed concern about Emperor Showa's attempts to intervene in politics. However, recently, he has become more and more convinced of the need to express the will of the imperial court and suggested that direct descendants (for example, the emperor's brothers) should be one of the pillars of this will."
 NW_JAP.703.a: "It seems even Saionji has realized that the country has reached the brink of an abyss."
 NW_JAP.704.t: "Proposal for a New Fishing Convention"
 NW_JAP.704.d: "The first intergovernmental agreement specifically dedicated to fisheries issues was the Fishing Convention concluded between Russia and Japan on July 15, 1907. Based on the Treaty of Portsmouth, it secured exceptionally broad rights for the use of the fish resources of the coastal areas of the Russian Far East. The Kamchatka fishing district, previously 'preserved' for Russia due to its remoteness, was 'unpreserved' for the Japanese.\n\nAt the beginning of the century, Russo-Japanese contacts in the field of fisheries were a complex combination of contradictions and cooperation. Russian fishermen, protecting their interests, tried with the help of the Priamurye Governor-Generalship to limit the extremely developed fishing activities of Japanese fishermen off the coast of Primorye. At the same time, it was difficult for Russian fish industrialists to do without Japanese fishing techniques and gear, purchased in Japan, and without Japanese sales markets, which by the beginning of the 20th century were one of the main ones for Russian fish exports in the Far East.\n\nIn 1925, with the establishment of diplomatic relations between the USSR and Japan, negotiations on fisheries began, which were difficult and continued until 1928. In 1928, the first Soviet-Japanese Fishing Convention was concluded. Japan leased 255 out of 511 salmon fishing plots and 14 out of 47 crab fishing plots. In addition, for both Soviet Russia and Japan, the signing of the fishing agreement essentially became the first step towards legally regulated relations between the countries, albeit within a single industry and a single region.\n\nIts term expired in 1932, but it was extended for another 4 years. Now its new term is expiring, and as a result, the Japanese government is proposing that we conclude a new convention that will take into account the changes in the nature of the fishing industry over the past years: new technologies and scales of extraction."
 NW_JAP.704.a: "We are ready to conclude a new agreement."
 NW_JAP.704.b: "We will not negotiate with the imperialists."
 NW_JAP.705.t: "Signing of the New Fishing Convention"
 NW_JAP.705.d: "The Soviet government has approved our proposal to conclude a new fishing agreement due to the expiration of the previous one and changes in the scale and nature of this industry in the Far East."
 NW_JAP.705.a: "This is a step towards normalizing relations."
 NW_JAP.706.t: "Refusal to Conclude a New Fishing Agreement"
 NW_JAP.706.d: "The Soviet government has refused to conclude a new fishing convention with us concerning this activity in the Far Eastern waters belonging to the Soviet Union but little used by them. This may indicate their aggressive stance towards us and a desire to eliminate even our current fishing industry volumes."
 NW_JAP.706.a: "We will look for options to preserve the treaty."
 NW_JAP.707.t: "Extension of the Fishing Convention with Japan" 
 NW_JAP.707.d: "Due to our refusal to conclude a new fishing agreement with the Japanese Empire, its government is proposing that we at least extend the previous convention for another year. Refusing even this offer and allowing the 1928 convention to expire will lead to a sharp deterioration in relations with Japan."
 NW_JAP.707.a: "Let's extend the old convention."
 NW_JAP.707.b: "We will not extend the convention."
 NW_JAP.708.t: "The Soviets Have Extended the Convention"
 NW_JAP.708.d: "The Soviet government has agreed to extend the 1928 fishing convention for another year. This suggests they do not want a complete breakdown of relations, and perhaps within the next year, we can achieve a full-fledged new convention."
 NW_JAP.708.a: "All is not lost yet."
 NW_JAP.709.t: "The Soviets Refused to Extend the Convention"
 NW_JAP.709.d: "The Soviet government has refused to extend the 1928 fishing convention for another year, which confirms the suspicions of some of our diplomats about the aggressive intentions of the Soviet government in the Far East and their desire to end mutually beneficial cooperation in the fishing industry in this region." 
 NW_JAP.709.a: "We must prepare for this."
 NW_JAP.710.t: "Fishing Convention with Japan Terminated"
 NW_JAP.710.d: "At the beginning of the century, Russo-Japanese contacts in the field of fisheries were a complex combination of contradictions and cooperation.

Since then, negotiations for an additional extension of its term or the conclusion of a new agreement have not been successful, and today it has ceased to be in effect, which means that Japanese fishermen and fishing companies no longer have the right to be in our waters. In this regard, a deterioration of relations with the Japanese Empire should be expected, which may use this as a reason for armed provocations."
 NW_JAP.710.a: "We will be ready for this."

 NW_JAP.711.d.a: "Today, Prime Minister Konoe is resigning, but at the same time, he wishes to take the post of Lord Keeper of the Privy Seal, which is currently held by Yuasa Kurahei. Genro Saionji has opposed this move, calling it 'illogical,' and seeks to prevent Konoe, who has strong support from the army, from gaining influence at the imperial court, as the role of the Lord Keeper, despite its name, involves controlling all of the emperor's contacts with the government and ministers."
 NW_JAP.711.d.b: "Today, Prime Minister Konoe is resigning, but at the same time, he wishes to take the post of Lord Keeper of the Privy Seal, which is currently held by Yuasa Kurahei. Konoe has strong support from the army to gain influence at the imperial court, as the role of the Lord Keeper, despite its name, involves controlling all of the emperor's contacts with the government and ministers."

 NW_JAP.712.d: "Due to Prince Konoe taking on a new position, his friend and fellow member of the 'young aristocrats,' Koichi Kido, with whom he studied at university, will replace him as Lord Keeper of the Privy Seal. Kido proved himself during the February 26 Incident by maintaining communication between the emperor and genro Saionji, and has since held several ministerial posts."
 NW_JAP.712.a: "They are forming a powerful alliance."
 NW_JAP.713.t: "Conflict in the Diplomatic Corps in Berlin"
 NW_JAP.713.d: "Our ambassador in Berlin is Shigenori Togo, an ethnic Korean whose father adopted a Japanese surname and gave his son a Japanese name. After receiving an education in German literature at Meiji University, he passed the diplomat exams and joined the diplomatic corps in Berlin immediately after the end of the Great War. During his service, Togo met and fell in love with a Jewish German newspaper reporter, Edde de Lalande. It is said that their relationship began under the influence of a collection of Goethe's romantic poems. After returning from Germany, he convinced his parents, who were against the marriage, and they married at the famous Imperial Hotel in Tokyo in 1922.\n\nAt that time, Germany was going through a period of turmoil, but Japanese-German relations were relatively stable. However, by now the Nazi party has consolidated its power, and the situation has changed dramatically. Their aggressive foreign policy, but primarily their domestic policy, such as the persecution of Jews, is becoming more and more obvious. Initially devoted to German literature and with a deep understanding of German culture, Togo cannot help but feel hatred for the Nazis.\n\nAt the same time, the post of military attache is held by General Hiroshi Oshima, a great admirer of Nazism—many think more of Nazism than of Germany, although he knows German perfectly, which has allowed him to establish close contact with the Nazi foreign policy leader Joachim von Ribbentrop since his appointment to this post in 1934. Thanks to this, he has already met with the Fuhrer himself several times. His idea is to conclude a military alliance between Japan and Germany, which is supported by many mid-ranking officers of the Imperial Army. Because of this, a strong antagonistic relationship has been established between our ambassador and attache, and Oshima is even trying to 'squeeze' Togo out of his position through his connections in the army leadership with the aim of becoming the ambassador in Berlin himself. We must resolve this conflict so that it does not lead to a loss of Japan's reputation in the eyes of the Germans."
 NW_JAP.713.a: "Let Oshima take the post he desires."
 NW_JAP.713.b: "Oshima must do his job and not interfere in diplomacy."
 NW_JAP.714.t: "Change of Ambassador in Moscow"
 NW_JAP.714.d: "The recall of Shigenori Togo from Berlin allows this experienced diplomat to be used for other important diplomatic work. Currently, our embassy in Moscow is facing difficulties, where Mamoru Shigemitsu, the diplomat who concluded the agreement to end the 1932 Shanghai Incident, holds his position. During its signing, a Korean terrorist carried out an attack, as a result of which Mamoru lost a leg, but despite this, he completed all his diplomatic duties. Over the past two years, he has not managed to establish good contact with Soviet diplomats, and on the contrary, there is a feeling that the Soviet government is biased against Mamoru. We value his abilities, but perhaps we should carry out a reshuffle of ambassadors, sending Togo to Moscow and Mamoru to the United Kingdom, where his experience will bring more success."
 NW_JAP.714.a: "We shall do so."
 NW_JAP.714.b: "Mamoru will remain in his position, and Togo will go to London."
 NW_JAP.715.t: "Negotiations with the Japanese Ambassador"
 NW_JAP.715.d: "The new Japanese ambassador in Moscow is proposing to our government to conclude an agreement with Japan to improve relations between the countries. According to the Japanese ambassador's idea, each side will make mutual concessions: Japan will renounce its claims to the northern part of Sakhalin Island and liquidate its concessions there, and the USSR will cease supplying aid to the Chinese government. A neutrality pact will also be signed between our states."
 NW_JAP.715.a: "We are ready to accept these terms."
 NW_JAP.715.b: "We are ready only on the condition of the return of Southern Sakhalin."
 NW_JAP.716.t: "Unsuccessful Negotiations with Moscow"
 NW_JAP.716.d: "The negotiations our ambassador conducted in Moscow with Soviet diplomatic representatives have failed. The Soviets demanded too high a price for such an agreement, only at the cost of ceding Southern Sakhalin, which is an absurd proposal not based in reality."
 NW_JAP.716.a: "We understand their position."
 NW_JAP.717.t: "The Fate of the Jews"
 NW_JAP.717.d.a: "Since the end of the Great War, the theme of Zionism and support for the Jews has been supported by some Japanese intellectuals and politicians. In the 1920s, 'Jewish experts' emerged in the army and navy: Army Colonel Yasue Norihiro and Navy Captain Koreshige Inuzuka, who began to study the Jewish way of life and conditions around the world. After the proclamation of Manchukuo, they established contact with the Manchurian faction in the army, and Yasue directly became a member of it, and thanks to this, they began to promote their idea in the government. It consists of inviting from 50,000 to 600,000 or even a million Jews from Europe to resettle in Manchuria, near Harbin, where the necessary infrastructure will be created for them, and full religious and cultural freedom will be provided in accordance with the principles of racial equality we promote. These Jews will bring their capital with them, or at least help to form a positive image of Japan in the United States of America, where the Jewish lobby is known to be strong."
 NW_JAP.717.d.b: "$NW_JAP.717.d.a$\n\nHowever, this plan faces problems due to a possible alliance between Germany and our country, where some politicians express their dissatisfaction with our promoted idea of racial equality with the Jews."

 NW_JAP.717.b: "We will be ready to accept them and treat them on an equal level with other peoples."
 NW_JAP.717.c: "We will ban Jewish immigration."
 NW_JAP.718.t: "Choosing the Location for Autonomy"
 NW_JAP.718.d: "Since our army has captured the city of Shanghai and its surroundings, we have a choice between which region to grant autonomy to the Jewish population. It was initially assumed that Manchukuo, which supports the principles of racial harmony, would become the new home for the Jews, but the Jews there only ended up after the civil war in Russia, having fled there with other Russian emigrants. However, an even larger number of them have long lived in Shanghai, which is also a more Europeanized city with a large number of foreigners who will thus be able to better study and see with their own eyes the creation of comfortable living conditions for the Jews, improving Japan's image and attracting even more settlers. On the other hand, this will cause even more problems and conflicts with the local Chinese population and undermine the legitimacy of local governments."
 NW_JAP.718.a: "The Jews should settle in Manchukuo."
 NW_JAP.718.b: "The Jews should settle in Shanghai and its surroundings."
 NW_JAP.719.t: "Guiding Principles Regarding the Jews"
 NW_JAP.719.d: "A special government conference dedicated specifically to the issue of dealing with the Jews has finally issued its affirmative verdict on the long-standing plan of the Jewish experts from the Manchurian faction of the military on the need to attract the Jewish population fleeing persecution in Europe under the wing of the Japanese Empire, specifically to Manchukuo, where they will be provided with all the conditions for creating their cultural and religious autonomy within the framework of our state's racial harmony. Now our government is faced with the question of where the Jewish settlers will create their new national home—two options are being considered: either the Jews will be able to settle freely throughout the territory of Manchukuo, or they will be given one province for settlement. In the latter case, such a province will be the former Rehe region on the border with China, which will allow for additional demarcation between our states."
 NW_JAP.719.a: "The Jews can settle freely."
 NW_JAP.719.b: "The Jews should be allocated a region in the former Rehe province."
 NW_JAP.720.t: "The Reform Bureaucrats Have Crossed the Line"
 NW_JAP.720.d: "The reform bureaucrats have gone too far with their reforms—with their ambitious plans, they have frightened almost all layers of the old elites: the owners of the zaibatsu, conservative and traditional politicians, some military personnel, and even the Imperial Court. All this led to the Prime Minister having to resign, making way for someone else with less radical views on restructuring the country. According to the recommendation of the senior vassals, it could be Prince Fumimaro Konoe, who has long been preparing to take this post, or Kiichiro Hiranuma, a long-time opponent of all left-wing reformers."
 NW_JAP.720.a: "Technocracy was not realized this time; Konoe will take over." 
 NW_JAP.720.b: "Technocracy was not realized this time; Hiranuma will restore stability."
 NW_JAP.721.t: "Spy Ring Uncovered in Tokyo"
 NW_JAP.721.d: "The Special Higher Police have been investigating a communist spy network in Tokyo for over a year. The other day, they finally found a lead through a random clue and arrested one of the participants, a Japanese man of Okinawan origin who had been living on the Pacific coast of the USA for a long time, where a large number of communist spies are known to operate. After a search and interrogation at his home, he gave up the other members of the group: Branko de Vukelic, the Far East correspondent for the Parisian news agency Havas; Max Clausen, a German trade representative; Richard Sorge, a PhD from Hamburg University, a representative of the Frankfurter Zeitung and the senior German correspondent in Tokyo, a regular contributor to the most influential strategic journal in Germany, Zeitschrift fur Geopolitik, and, most importantly, the personal political advisor and confidant of the German ambassador in Tokyo, General Eugen Ott. But the heaviest blow was that the fifth participant was Hotsumi Ozaki—one of Prince Konoe's closest advisors, also a journalist and, as was believed, an expert on Asian politics. When Konoe learned of Ozaki's true identity, he was shocked and apologized to the Emperor, saying: 'I deeply regret and feel a deep responsibility for what was completely unknown to me.'"
 NW_JAP.721.a: "Konoe must resign to take responsibility for the incident." 
 NW_JAP.721.b: "Konoe knew who he was dealing with and will surely regret it."
 NW_JAP.722.t: "Purge in the Ministry of Commerce and Industry"
 NW_JAP.722.d: "For the last 6 years, the Ministry of Commerce and Industry has been under the control of the so-called Yoshino-Kishi line—two bureaucrats: the mentor Shinji Yoshino and his closest assistant Nobusuke Kishi. Yoshino was one of the first bureaucrats in the ministry to lobby for the ideas of targeted industrial development back in the 1920s, which was facilitated by his experience studying abroad during the Great War. Kishi, although his 'successor,' is an even more radical figure—he is one of the most prominent representatives of the so-called 'reform bureaucrats,' a group of young professionals who want to establish a controlled economy in particular and increase government power in general, looking at similar examples in Germany and the Soviet Union. Such ideas cannot but cause discontent among representatives of business and the financial world.\n\nIn the Ministry of Commerce and Industry, the military mutiny alarmed many otherwise complacent bureaucrats; Yoshino admits in private conversations that as a result of this incident, he lost control of the ministry. The military began to have even more influence on appointments in the cabinet, but within the ministries, passive resistance to the militarists and their friends was developing. Business leaders also began to cautiously oppose the Yoshino-Kishi line, but they cannot speak out openly for fear of new assassination attempts. However, to secure the cooperation of industry, the military had to compromise on whom they were willing to see as Minister of Commerce and Industry, which meant tolerating ministers who were graduates of Kyoto University or were acceptable to business. One such compromise candidate was Ogawa Gotaro, a former professor of economics at Kyoto University and a member of the House of Representatives from the Rikken Minseito, elected since 1917.\n\nTo get rid of Yoshino and Kishi, Ogawa chose a conciliatory tactic: he offered Yoshino to head the newly created Tohoku Industrial Development Company, a Japanese version of the Tennessee Valley Authority for the development of a backward region. And he told Kishi that the Kwantung Army had urgently requested his work in the government of Manchukuo (which was true). Yoshino considered refusing to resign on the grounds that as an imperial official he could not be dismissed, but changed his mind. He realized that he had been in the post of vice-minister for too long and knew that junior officials in the ministry were holding meetings on the political situation to which he was not invited. One day, Yoshino and Kishi jointly submitted their resignations. Yoshino went to Tohoku, where he was born, and Kishi became the deputy director of the Industrial Department of the Manchukuo government."

Among the military itself, the candidacy of Seishirō Itagaki is being promoted – Kanji Ishiwara's closest friend and the leader of the Manchurian military faction, who organized the seizure of Manchuria, but at the same time staunchly supported the suppression of the coup of young officers and personally led this process, several times risking his life negotiating with the rebels. Another negative feature of Itagaki is his possible inexperience and lack of rank for such a high position. An alternative in this case may be the extremely capable General Hisaichi Terauchi, who remains neutral in the confrontation between the army factions and has great influence in the army, but is in a depressed state and has expressed thoughts about leaving the army in the event of its purge. On the other hand, Terauchi was involved in the "Go-Stop incident," in which a verbal altercation between two young men, an off—duty soldier in uniform who ignored a traffic light, and a policeman escalated into a fight and, eventually, into a conflict at the government level between the Ministry of the Interior and the army.."

 NW_JAP.732.t: "Military Resistance to Ugaki's Cabinet"
 NW_JAP.732.d.a: "General Ugaki faced fierce resistance from the army in forming his government. On his way to the Imperial Palace to receive the imperial order for the formation of the cabinet, his car was stopped by the military police, the commander of the military police, General Nakajima Kesago, sat down with him and demanded that Ugaki refuse to form a government. However, the general did not succumb to this provocation and accepted the imperial decree. Then the "three chiefs of the army" (the former Minister of the Army, the Chief of the General Staff and the General Superintendent of Education) refused to nominate a candidate for the post of the new Minister of the Army or accept any of Ugaki's proposals, threatening to dismiss any general whom Ugaki decides to appoint as Minister of Army in his cabinet.\n\nThe last time such a crisis occurred was in 1913, after Emperor Taishō mounted the throne, when the military also refused to appoint an army minister to the government and, after a brief standoff, they were deprived of the right to sabotage the formation of the cabinet by imperial decree. After reviewing all his further possible options, General Ugaki realized that there was only one option left – the emperor should again, like his father, issue his "imperial decree" in 1913, forcing the military to provide an army minister to the government."
 NW_JAP.732.d.b: "$NW_JAP.732.d.a$\n\nHowever, the Lord Keeper of the Privy Seal, Yuasa Kurahei, expressed his negative attitude towards such a proposal.

Ugaki took a piece of paper with the text and read it out in front of a crowd of correspondents:\n\n- ...in this regard, I reject the Imperial Decree on the formation of the Cabinet of Ministers.\n\nThese words became a political bomb – journalists began to ask new, clarifying questions on a break, camera flashes snapped. Tired of the fuss of the last few days, the general landed in a chair and wiped his sweaty forehead with a handkerchief. Despite the barely conscious problem of what had happened, Ugaki had a smile on his face, as if he had finally gotten rid of a case that he was very tired of. He was happy to answer questions, realizing that now he could throw all these endless problems of the state onto someone else, albeit at the cost of violating the word given to the emperor.\n\nNewspaper headlines today were full of various vivid phrases, but the most popular line was "the miscarriage of Ugaki's office" - it most succinctly outlined the event that took place in the country."

Everyone abruptly realized how powerful the military had become after the February 26 incident and how great their ability to manipulate the civilian government was. Genrō Saionji was so disappointed that he refused to give new advice to the emperor, as he considered it necessary to issue an imperial decree to put pressure on the military.\n\nPrince Fumimaro Konoe was so outraged by Ugaki's inability to form his cabinet due to the army's interference that he wrote a letter reproaching General Terauchi. In his letter, Konoe argues that while it makes sense to discuss politics from the point of view of "right and wrong," rejecting a person who has received an imperial order to become prime minister does not make sense and raises serious concerns about justice and respect for the national order of the state. When some of Konoe's associates, fearing that the letter might lead to something fatal for him, tried to stop him, the prince told them that he was not sorry to die for a just cause.\n\nGeneral Senjūrō Hayashi was chosen as the new Prime Minister. Due to Genrō Saionji's refusal to communicate, a new recommendation had to be given personally to the Lord Keeper of the Small Seal Yuase Kurahei after consultations with Konoe and some former ministers and prime ministers."

Almost immediately after the incident, he expressed the idea of the danger of the complete liquidation of the Kōdōha within the army, since in this case all previous problems with the army would be attributed to it and this would give moral authority and strength to the surviving army factions, especially their main competitors– the Tōseiha. Given Masaki's position as one of the central figures of Kōdōha, the direction of Masaki's fate will be potentially explosive. In addition, many have expressed misunderstanding and dissatisfaction with such unfair treatment of Masaki compared to General Ugaki after the March 1931 incident. Like Masaki, Ugaki was not directly involved in the incident. Therefore, he did not appear before the court then. For many radical right-wing nationalists, as well as Konoe himself, what happened to Masaki was a heavy blow and unfair compared to how Ugaki was treated."

In its closing statement, the prosecution requested 13 years in prison for helping the rebels.\n\nGeneral Sadao Araki continues to plead for Masaki's acquittal, mostly through Prince Konoe, who supports the idea.

All this became known thanks to the secretary of the grand Chamberlain Kantarō Suzuki, Yuase Kurahei – he managed to escape and enter the Imperial Palace, where he told that the grand chamberlain was seriously injured, but still alive – after the young officer shot him twice with a pistol, and was about to deliver a decisive blow with a sword, his wife Suzuki begged to be allowed to do it herself, and believing that Suzuki was already mortally wounded, he left them, apologizing to her and explaining that it was done for the sake of the nation. He then ordered his men to salute Suzuki, and they left his residence. Suzuki's wife was Emperor Hirohito's closest nanny as a child, and he even called her mom, as he had much less contact with his own mother. At the moment, Suzuki is receiving secret help due to the fact that his neighbor is the president of the Nippon Medical School, as well as the opportunity to take the wounded chamberlain to the hospital in a taxi, which the rebels did not check."

 NW_JAP.753.desc: "The ideology of Nohonshugi (literally "agrarianism") first emerged in the Meiji era as a reaction to attempts to develop industry and trade at the expense of agriculture. According to the leaders of this movement, the peasants did not need lectures on the virtues of thrift and diligence. These qualities were necessary for their survival. Peasant families traditionally insisted on not leaving a single grain of rice in their bowls. Unnecessary consumption was considered sinful, and daily work was especially respected. Nohonsugi inspires farmers with the idea that agriculture is the most natural and rewarding occupation and a key industry in the country, and that urban industrialization is an important cause of moral degradation.\n\nRomanticized by militant nationalists who condemned industrialization, bureaucratization and the "invasion" of foreign cultures in Japan, it influenced many politicians with different views, rooted in their programs, however, it also has its own clear ideas about the wonderful future of Japan, promoted by its two main ideologues: Kozaburo Tachibana and Gondō Seikyō.\n\nHowever, one should not think that these two men have a similar vision of the same movement to which they both belong. First, it's worth considering the difference in their ages – Tachibana is 25 years younger than Gondō, and naturally perceives rural depression in a slightly different way. Although they published their major ideological works almost simultaneously, Gondō was writing at the peak of a chequered life spent mostly in cities, while Tachibana was a rural farmer educator at the age of thirty-five when he suddenly emerged as a representative of agrarian nationalism. Gondō, the older, thoughtful, and erudite of the two, has no personal experience of political violence, unlike Tachibana, who spent more than four years in prison for his involvement in the May 15, 1932 incident. Although their careers and especially their ideas had a lot in common, Gondō and Tachibana were separated by an entire generation and this affects their vision of what the Japanese Empire should be like."

 NW_JAP.754.desc: "After the first few battles, in which the Imperial Army and the Imperial Japanese Navy participated, a serious problem emerged that could lead the country to disaster if not taken seriously – the navy and the army are completely unaware of each other's activities, as they have isolated themselves within their own chains of command – each of the branches of the armed forces is present They have their own general staff and their own ministry, lobbying for their interests and not informing other structures, often hiding it under the guise of military secrecy. One of the reasons for this was the so-called "supreme command issue", a dispute in the early 1930s after the conclusion of the London Naval Agreement, when Prime Minister Osachi Hamaguchi and the civilian government pressed the Navy with the support of the Emperor and his liberal dignitaries, despite the opposition of the Navy Faction to the conclusion of this agreement. After that, in 1931, an assassination attempt was carried out on Hamaguchi, as a result of which he died, and in the navy some admirals began to promote the idea of disobeying the civilian government, if they considered it necessary. It is likely that under the influence of this thought, the military captured Manchuria, as well as other subsequent incidents, ignoring Tokyo's opinion. At the same time, the main argument of the military, both in the navy and in the army, lies in a relatively legal plane – officially, according to the Meiji Constitution, the Imperial Navy and Army are subordinate not to the government, but directly to the emperor. However, gradually, some military and civilian politicians developed a clear opinion that since the government obeys the will of the emperor, the army and navy should follow the decisions of the Prime Minister and his cabinet, in the manner of how it happens in the United Kingdom or other European countries. But now it has become clear that the leadership of the army and Navy completely refuse to follow this rule."

 NW_JAP.756.desc: "Земельный налог 1873 года был краеугольным камнем модернизации Мэйдзи. Его введение имело революционные последствия. Во-первых, это была легализация частной собственности - впервые в истории Японии он «предоставил законное право собственности на землю по акту». Земля превратилась из основы общинной жизни в товар, который можно было покупать и продавать. Во-вторых, это была фискальная реформа - он заменил старую феодальную дань, которая была процентом от урожая и выплачивалась натурой (рисом), на фиксированный налог (первоначально 3%), выплачиваемый наличными и основанный на рыночной стоимости земли. Для правительства Мэйдзи преимущества были очевидны. Это обеспечило стабильный, предсказуемый доход, не зависящий от колебаний урожая, что позволило правительству составлять бюджет и финансировать индустриализацию за счет доходов от сельского хозяйства. Эта политика была «решающей для платежеспособности правительства». Однако социальные последствия для деревни были катастрофическими. Требование платить наличными, независимо от того, насколько плохим был урожай, вынудило многих мелких фермеров брать займы под высокие проценты, что привело к потере права выкупа и массовой консолидации земли в руках помещиков. В итоге, эта политика привела к резкому росту арендаторства.\n\nГондо Сэйкё атаковал этот налог не просто как экономически обременительный, но как моральное и политическое преступление. Он назвал его «самой возмутительной и противоречивой политикой из всех». Гондо утверждал, что реформа была циничным захватом власти чиновниками Мэйдзи, «отвлеченными собственной жаждой власти», которые использовали ее для «укрепления позиций лидеров через силу богатства». Превратив землю в товар с ценой, налог «отрезал людей от земли». Он разрушил священную связь между фермером и землей, которая была основой шашоку. Налог стал буквально топливом для бюрократии - налог «раздул доходы государства» и «способствовал угнетению фермерских деревень». Он был финансовым двигателем, который финансировал создание и расширение ненавистной Гондо бюрократической централизации. Для Гондо Земельный налог 1873 года был не просто фискальной мерой - это был «первородный грех» японской современности. В этом едином акте гармоничное шашоку было разрушено и заменено «неестественным» союзом бюрократии и капитализма. Отмена налога была, таким образом, первым и самым необходимым шагом к демонтажу всей современной государственной структуры."

 NW_JAP.757.t: "Прекрасная Япония прошлого"
 NW_JAP.757.desc: "Аграрные националисты используют идеализированную историю как свое главное оружие для критики современности. Они утверждали, что бюрократия Мэйдзи и капитализм дзайбацу были не эволюцией, а отклонением от «истинного» японского пути. Их целью было «вернуться к сохранившейся сущности основания страны». Гондо Сэйкё, в частности, построил сложную, хотя и исторически сомнительную, утопию, основанную на его интерпретации древнего прошлого. Он верил в «постепенное развитие добрых обычаев» (сэйзоку), которые были насильственно прерваны «искусственными схемами» современного государства. \n\nГондо изображал доисторическую Японию как время, когда «провинциальные губернаторы были все хранителями богов». Общество было неразрывно связано с синтоистскими ритуалами, а «небесные грехи» определялись как «препятствия для сельского хозяйства». Наиболее парадоксально то, что Гондо почитал Реформы Тайка (645 г. н.э.) — событие, которое большинство историков считают попыткой централизации по китайскому образцу — как апогей самоуправления. Он утверждал, что реформы «в действительности не вмешивались в добрые практики» на местах. Напротив, они «позволяли самоуправление в каждом регионе» и «использовали сельских и уездных старост». Для Гондо это был золотой век «совместного правления императора и народа». Хотя Гондо критиковал сёгунат Токугава за «путаницу» в денежной системе, он, тем не менее, утверждал, что самоуправление было «гораздо более эффективным» в период Эдо, чем после 1868 года, и что фермеры были счастливее.\n\nТатибана Кодзабуро разделял этот ретроспективный взгляд, призывая к возвращению к «древней восточноазиатской земельной системе» как основе для реформ. Столкнувшись с необходимостью критиковать японское государство Мэйдзи, не выглядя при этом антияпонскими, они решили эту проблему, заявив, что они являются истинными патриотами, а правительство Мэйдзи — предателем «истинной» японской традиции. Они не могли использовать период Токугава в качестве своего идеала, поскольку он был дискредитирован как «феодальный» и коррумпированный. Вместо этого они перепрыгнули через столетия японской истории к мифологическому, дофеодальному, синтоистскому прошлому (периоды Судзин и Тайка), которое было достаточно туманным, чтобы на него можно было спроецировать свои идеалы джити (самоуправления) и шашоку (гармонии). Эта «традиция» была не восстановлением истории, а созданием идеологического оружия для ведения войны против настоящего."

 NW_JAP.758.t: "Коварный альянс"
 NW_JAP.758.desc: "Гондо утверждал, что государство Мэйдзи, «смоделированное по образцу Франции и Пруссии», насильственно навязало японскому народу бюрократическое правление. Он рассматривал хваленую систему местного самоуправления 1888 года как циничную «уловку». Он заклеймил ее как «бюрократическую автономию», поскольку она не предоставляла деревням реальной власти; она просто превратила их в низший эшелон централизованной административной иерархии. Вместо того чтобы позволить деревням править самими собой, эта система заставила их управлять от имени Токио. Последствия, по мнению Гондо, были катастрофическими. Бюрократическое правительство «вызвало отчуждение низших и высших и нынешние страдания нашего народа». Оно было «разрушительным для шашоку». Его критика была абсолютной - Гондо был бы весьма счастлив полностью упразднить централизованное бюрократическое правительство. Эта позиция делает его, по сути, политическим анархистом или, по крайней мере, радикальным децентралистом. В отличие от стандартного марксистского анализа, который рассматривает государство как надстройку, возведенную на капиталистической экономической базе, Гондо, по-видимому, перевернул эту формулу. Он считал, что именно бюрократическая централизация (то есть политическая структура) была первопричиной, которая позволила и способствовала возникновению монополистического капитализма (экономической структуры). Этот анализ очевиден из его аргументов. Земельный налог 1873 года (политический акт) и импорт «прусского национализма» (политическая идеология) были действиями государства, которые создали условия для экономической монополизации. Именно альянс «плутократов» (дзайбацу) и «тех, кто у власти» (бюрократов) был врагом. Решение Гондо было, следовательно, в первую очередь политическим: восстановить джити (самоуправление). Он считал, что, если бы джити существовало, монополистический капитализм не смог бы развиться. Таким образом, ликвидация бюрократической централизации была предпосылкой для любого значимого экономического или социального исцеления."

Право контролировать спокойствие деревни (т.е. местные полицейские полномочия).\n\n2.	Право регулировать товары для продовольствия, одежды и жилья сельских жителей (т.е. экономический контроль и установление цен).\n\n3.	Право управлять деревенской обороной, санитарией и населением (т.е. полномочия местной милиции, общественного здравоохранения и демографической политики).\n\n4.	Право распоряжаться активами и пассивами деревни (т.е. полномочия деревенского казначейства и банка).\n\n5.	Право вести переговоры с другими деревнями, а также право вести переговоры по вопросам транспорта и ирригации (т.е. общественные работы и «внешние сношения»).\n\n6.	Право контролировать учебные заведения (т.е. контроль над образованием).\n\n7.	Право выступать посредником в спорах между сельскими жителями (т.е. местные судебные полномочия).\n\n8.	Право санкционировать или ограничивать предприятия людей, живущих в деревне (т.е. полномочия по экономическому регулированию и зонированию).\n\nПлан Гондо заключался в том, чтобы расчленить суверенитет центрального государства (кокка) и передать эти суверенные полномочия тысячам отдельных деревенских общин (киодотай). Его идеалом была не единая нация-государство, а федерация суверенных, самоуправляемых деревень, объединенных только культурной и духовной преданностью Императору."

Таким образом, они превращаются в пассивных рантье. Реальное управление фирмами передается отраслевым «Контрольным ассоциациям» (Тосейкай). Руководители этих ассоциаций, отобранные по принципу компетентности (а не владения), получают статус государственных чиновников. Таким образом, мотив частной прибыли (главный для дзайбацу) заменялся мотивом выполнения государственного плана (главным для менеджера-бюрократа).

Это был переход от строительства отдельных объектов к проектированию целых экосистем. Примерами такого подхода были проект улучшения реки Ляохэ в Маньчжоу-Го и строительство мега-плотин, таких как Фэнмань и Супхун. «Комплексная технология» была практическим инструментом для реализации более широкой концепции — «Национального планирования земель».

Таким образом, «улучшение положения» было стратегией замещения. Материальные требования (повышение заработной платы), лежавшие в основе классовой борьбы, заменяются социально-психологическими вознаграждениями: «статусом», «честью» и чувством принадлежности к единой национальной семье.

Таким образом, «досовременный» этнический дух будет использован как инструмент для достижения ультрасовременной цели: тотально мобилизованного, высокотехнологичного государства, свободного от «саботажа» классовой борьбы."

 NW_JAP.769.t: "Технократический менталитет"
 NW_JAP.769.desc: "Критика либерального капитализма была фундаментальным камнем в идеологии реформистских бюрократов. Они не просто отвергают отдельные аспекты системы; они атакуют её основополагающие принципы: частную собственность, частную прибыль и автономию бизнеса. Для этих новых элит менеджеров Великая депрессия и сопутствующий ей финансовый кризис в Японии стали неопровержимым доказательством краха и «взрыва» либеральной капиталистической системы. Они считают классические либеральные идеи, такие как «экономический человек» (homo economicus) и принцип laissez-faire (невмешательства), безнадежно устаревшими. Лидер реформистских бюрократов, Киси Нобусукэ, наблюдая за индустриальной рационализацией в Германии, пришёл к выводу, что американский подход к капитализму, основанный на расточительной конкуренции, ценовых войнах и искусственном ограничении предложения ради прибыли, фундаментально неэффективен.\n\nТехнократы атаковали либеральный капитализм не потому, что он был слишком современным, а потому, что он был недостаточно современным и рациональным для управления сложным технологическим обществом, необходимым для ведения «тотальной войны». Ключевая проблема, с точки зрения технократов, заключается в неразрешимом противоречии между технологией и капитализмом. Новые технологии массового производства и сложная промышленная организация требуют централизованного, долгосрочного планирования и координации. Либеральный капитализм с его хаотичной конкуренцией и подчинением всех решений погоне за краткосрочной частной прибылью несовместим с этим требованием. Опираясь на идеи, схожие с идеями Торстейна Веблена, технократы считают, что капитализм «подчиняет» технологический прогресс «нетехническим целям» (погоне за прибылью), тем самым «саботируя» национальную мощь. Поэтому, чтобы полностью раскрыть потенциал науки и технологий и построить «технократическую сверхдержаву», необходимо сначала победить либеральный менталитет. На смену ему должны были прийти новые технократические принципы: «человек организации», «общественная прибыль» и всеобъемлющее «планирование»."

 NW_JAP.770.desc: "Маркиз Ёсичика Токугава является главой одной из боковых ветвей некогда могущественного клана Токугава, но несмотря на потерю своей политической власти, состояние и нажитое имущество никуда не делось. Их родным местом был город Нагоя, и когда в 1910 году отмечалось 300-летие основания Нагои, то маркиз с женой Ёсико посетили Большой фестиваль, организованный в честь этого события, в качестве главных празднующих. В рамках празднования семья Токугава провела в Нагое две выставки своих сокровищ, которые были хорошо приняты.В апреле 1912 года филологический факультет Токийского императорского университета и Киотский императорский университет обратились к Ёсичике с просьбой разрешить им осмотреть сокровища, и профессора и преподаватели обоих университетов посетили резиденцию Токугавы в Нагое. Они также провели фотографирование сокровищ. 18 мая того же года в актовом зале филологического факультета Токийского императорского университета состоялась выставка этих фотографий, которая привлекла большое внимание.\n\nЭти демонстрации сокровищ часто привлекали внимание, и считается, что Ёсичика почувствовал необходимость сохранить и выставить сокровища. Сортировка и оценка сокровищ были завершены к 1915 году, а 12 января 1920 года он объявил в газете о своем плане основать музей на территории своей резиденции для демонстрации сокровищ семьи своего клана. После оценки он ускорил продажу 10–15 % сокровищ, которые он посчитал дубликатами или ненужными, а в ноябре 1921 года он провел аукционы в Токийском художественном клубе и Нагойском художественном клубе, общая выручка от которых составила приблизительно 570 000 иен и была использована в качестве предварительного фонда для создания музея.\n\nОднако работы по созданию музея шли долго. В итоге, Ёсичико принял решение о создании двух музеев – одного в родной Нагое, а другого в Токио. В 1933 году на фоне Великой депрессии и финансовых трудностей многих представителей аристократии он провёл дополнительные закупки семейных реликвий других семей, например, принц Фумимаро Коноэ продал ему часть библиотеки своего рода. Наконец, в 1935 году Музей искусств Токугава в Токио и Музей Ходза Бунко в Нагое открыли свои коллекции для публики. Сегодня император Сёва посетил Музей искусств Токугава, его гидом был сам Ёситика. После этого посещения Ёсичика оставил запись в своём дневнике:\n\n«Я получил особенно тёплые слова по поводу основания музеев. Я от всего отказался и всё обрёл. Это большая честь.»"

If the total demand for goods at full employment is less than the total volume of production, the economy is forced to contract until equality is achieved.

 JAP_Naisen_Ittai_desc: "Korea had a great chance of becoming an independent state in Asia on a par with China and Japan - the Russian Empire stood up for it, seeking to weaken its neighbors in this way. However, the defeat in the Russo-Japanese War led to the expulsion of the Russians from the Korean peninsula and despite the continued assistance from the "White Tsar" (support of Korean diplomats at the international level, financing and arming of Korean guerrillas), 5 years later Korea was under the direct rule of the Japanese Empire in 1910, when the last (already puppet) Emperor of Korea Sunjong transferred all his sovereign power to the Japanese Emperor..\n\nIn 25 years, a whole generation of people who had never lived outside the Japanese Empire had grown up - and they had virtually lost interest in the idea of national independence, given how brutally any anti-Japanese demonstrations were suppressed. Koreans have become willing to put up with it if they can have some cultural autonomy: the ability to learn the Korean language, publish newspapers in it, and create art.\n\nThis long road will gradually lead to the full integration of Koreans and basically make them full citizens of the Empire, but it is resisted by members of the army, who are most often appointed as governors general of Korea. Leaving the Koreans in limbo will allow them to be used as cheap labor or perhaps even cannon fodder in future wars."

Therefore, the number of agrarian settlers amounted to a measly few hundred people.\n\nAfter the onset of the Great Depression, the condition of the country's peasant population deteriorated further, and many members of the Nohonshugi movement began to urge the government to pay attention to the plight of impoverished peasants. After the creation of Manchukuo, one way of solving this problem was to possibly help Japanese farmers resettle in Manchuria.

Japanese Turanists argued that the Japanese were of inland Asian origin and that the ancestors of the Japanese had migrated from Central Asia to conquer the Japanese islands. Kitagawa Shikazo argued that the Japanese were descended from the Tungus branch of the Turanian family, just like the Koreans and Manchus, whose roots were in northeast China, in Manchuria. And since the Japanese, Koreans and Manchus were descended from the Tungus, they also had links with other Turanian sub-ethnic groups such as the Turks, Mongols, Samoyeds and Finno-Ugri in terms of blood, language and culture. Over 20 years, several organizations had been established to strengthen cooperation with the Turanist countries and to print relevant literature. They insist that the Japanese leave the tragically small Japanese islands and move to the northern and western parts of the Asian continent where their ancestors once lived. To do this, they will have to reclaim these ancestral lands from the Slavs by making an alliance with the Turanian peoples."

 JAP_to_attract_right_wing_political_societies_to_the_Foreign_Ministry_category_desc: "The Amur River Society was created with the aim of opposing Russia, but in the end it turned into a convenient structure for secret operations around the world, which the official government cannot recognise. Moreover, since the founders of the Society were rather highly ideologised ultra-nationalists and to some extent independent from the authorities, sometimes their policy was quite realistically at odds with the line of the state, sometimes leading to acts of struggle between the government and the Society. Thus, for example, since the beginning of the century they have supported various anti-colonial movements in Asia - in India, the Philippines and China. It is no secret that both Sun Yat-sen and Chiang Kaishi are friends of the founders of the Amur River Society. One of Kōdōha's goals was to bring the Amur River Society to manage the country's foreign policy as the persons who are most interested in and consistently advocate the ideas of pan-Asianism in the world."

These ties have only grown stronger over time, and perhaps now it is time for the government to openly begin to make alliances with the Muslim countries of the Middle East, thus ‘incorporating’ them into Greater Asia."

After the Russo-Japanese War, this issue was settled by the special Fishing Convention of 1907, which established exceptionally broad rights for Japanese subjects to use the fish resources of the coastal regions of the Russian Far East.\n\nIn 1925, with the establishment of diplomatic relations between the USSR and Japan, negotiations on fisheries began, which were difficult and lasted until 1928. In 1928, the first Soviet-Japanese Fisheries Convention was concluded. Japan has leased 255 out of 511 salmon fishing sites and 14 out of 47 crab fishing sites. In addition, for both Soviet Russia and Japan, the signing of the fishing agreement was essentially the first step towards legally regulated relations between the countries, even within the same industry and the same region.\n\nHer term expired in 1932, but she was extended for another 4 years. Now its new term is also expiring, and the task has arisen either to conclude a new convention or to extend the old one. The first option is preferable, since the nature and scale of fishing has changed significantly over the past 10 years, new technologies have appeared, and all this needs to be clarified in the new agreement."

 NW_JAP_aht.1.t: "Rally for the Establishment of the Imperial Rule Assistance Association"
 NW_JAP_aht.1.d: "Before the inauguration of the Imperial Rule Assistance Association, a celebratory rally was held, during which leaders of the main political groups within it spoke. One of them was Seigō Nakano, who declared that a movement like the New Political Structure was possible only because, thanks to Japan's unique national polity, even opposing groups could unite."
 NW_JAP_aht.1.a: "A fine point."
 
 NW_JAP_aht.2.t: "Transformation of the Tōhōkai"
 NW_JAP_aht.2.d: "Seigō Nakano was appointed one of the eleven executive directors of the Imperial Rule Assistance Association. Before this, he dissolved his Tōhōkai party, but not completely - he transformed it into a cultural organization named Shintōsha, after the former Kaneko academy in Dairen. Among its branches is an academy called Shintjuku, dedicated to martial arts and the study of philosophy and history, where Nakano himself sometimes lectures."
 NW_JAP_aht.2.a: "Dissolved the party, but not quite."
 
 NW_JAP_aht.3.t: "Nakano's Speeches"
 NW_JAP_aht.3.d: "Seigō Nakano divides most of his time between meetings of the Board of Directors of the Imperial Rule Assistance Association, during which he must advise the government on policy and public sentiment, and giving speeches that are supposed to increase public involvement in the Association's activities. Naturally, however, they tend to increase the specific weight of his own faction within it."
 NW_JAP_aht.3.a: "A cunning plan."
 
 NW_JAP_aht.4.t: "Reorganization of Hashimoto's Party"
 NW_JAP_aht.4.d: "Kingorō Hashimoto, who has also reorganized his Great Japan Youth Party into the Sekiseikai (Society of Sincerity), is no less active in this period than his colleagues from the 'renovationist' camp, such as Seigō Nakano. For many outsiders, this raises questions about the sincerity of Hashimoto's intentions, but they do not know that this was a condition for Hashimoto's participation in the Imperial Rule Assistance Association project and the dissolution of his party."
 NW_JAP_aht.4.a: "He schemes and plays his own game."
 
 NW_JAP_aht.5.t: "Accusations from Bin Akao"
 NW_JAP_aht.5.d: "The right-wing traditionalists are extremely dissatisfied with the influence of right-wing radicals in the Imperial Rule Assistance Association due to their much larger number of members. Bin Akao, now one of the leading figures in the Japanist wing, has accused his rivals of insincerity for not completely dissolving their own organizations. This is primarily addressed to Seigō Nakano and Kingorō Hashimoto."
 NW_JAP_aht.5.a: "They have provoked a public reaction."
 
 NW_JAP_aht.6.t: "Attack on Nakano's Supporter"
 NW_JAP_aht.6.d: "Today, a surprise attack on supporters of Seigō Nakano occurred – during his visit to Hiroshima, a young supporter from his society's youth corps was wounded with a knife. It is believed that right-wing traditionalists may be responsible. It is also of some interest that Nakano's former 'bodyguard,' Terada Inejirō, has now switched to his opponents' camp, and his former functions have since been taken over by Sato Morio, a former soldier from the fighting in China."
 NW_JAP_aht.6.a: "It seems strife and disputes have only intensified with the Association's creation."
 
 NW_JAP_aht.7.t: "The New Economic Structure Project"
 NW_JAP_aht.7.d: "The Kikakuin, or Cabinet Planning Board, has developed a plan for a New Economic Structure, which represents an extreme form of state control, proposing to 'liberate management from the capitalist constraints applied in the pursuit of profit.'\nThis was to be achieved by limiting dividends and public control over the appointments of top management in key industries or control bodies, which would be coordinated by the Planning Bureau of the Imperial Rule Assistance Association.\nSmall enterprises would be ruthlessly rationalized."
 NW_JAP_aht.7.a: "It should be kept secret for now."
 NW_JAP_aht.7.b: "We should begin the process of its discussion."
 
 NW_JAP_aht.8.t: "Criticism of the New Economic Structure"
 NW_JAP_aht.8.d: "When the plan's contents became known, it was fiercely criticized by both business and right-wing traditionalists. A leading group, including the éminence grise Toyama and General Araki, wrote a letter to the Prime Minister demanding the dismissal of socialists from the Imperial Rule Assistance Association. Some members of the same group issued a 'Manifesto in Defense of the Constitution,' pointing out that the Constitution protects private property and accusing the 'renovationists' of aiding the enemy by sowing discord."
 NW_JAP_aht.8.a: "This was to be expected."
 
 NW_JAP_aht.9.t: "Discussion in the Cabinet"
 NW_JAP_aht.9.d: "During cabinet discussions, the New Economic Structure plan was criticized and amended by former party ministers and finance ministers, which, however, met with some resistance from the armed forces. The revised version of the plan was sent back to the Imperial Rule Assistance Association for consideration."
 NW_JAP_aht.9.a: "Very well."
 
 NW_JAP_aht.10.t: "Board of Directors Meeting"
 NW_JAP_aht.10.d: "The Board of Directors of the Imperial Rule Assistance Association discussed the draft of the New Economic Structure received after the cabinet's revisions, but did not fully agree with them and leaned towards adopting its original version, developed by the Cabinet Planning Board."
 NW_JAP_aht.10.a: "They will stand by this plan to the end."
 
 NW_JAP_aht.11.t: "Nakano's Alternative"
 NW_JAP_aht.11.d: "Seigō Nakano, with connections to both business and the military, has attempted to devise an alternative to the original New Economic Structure project that could better serve the interests of both sides. At the Board of Directors, he presented a nine-point statement on the 'basic principles of economic reform,' criticizing the Cabinet Planning Board for 'superficial theorizing' and 'left-wing totalitarianism disguised as Imperial Way totalitarianism,' which 'disregards the practical activities of private organizations, but in the name of uniformity of private life, property, and state administration, calls for their consolidation into companies engaged in national policy.'\nIn contrast, he proposed that 'private organizations play an independent role in carrying out national policy,' allowing for some competition between them in the interests of increasing efficiency."
 NW_JAP_aht.11.d.add: "\n\nHe viewed France under the Popular Front of socialism as a catastrophic example, while Nazi Germany had found the right formula."
 NW_JAP_aht.11.a: "We will consider it."
 
 NW_JAP_aht.12.t: "Compromise Bill"
 NW_JAP_aht.12.d: "The creation of a worthy compromise version of the New Economic Structure project has occupied the main attention of the members of the Imperial Rule Assistance Association. It proposes a bill on industrial organizations that would provide for economic control through autonomous associations in accordance with its general plan. They would select executives to cooperate with the Kikakuin in planning and with the Ministry of Commerce and Industry in implementing projects, which would be carried out according to government instructions sent to the associations.\n\nOther features included that excess profits would be converted into bonds; small enterprises would be rationalized only in case of difficulties; wages would be proportional to efficiency, and management would not be appointed by the state, except for industrial associations, and then on the basis of nominations by members."
 NW_JAP_aht.12.a: "This is a good solution."
 
 NW_JAP_aht.13.t: "Difficulties with the Compromise"
 NW_JAP_aht.13.d: "Although the compromise bill was planned for discussion in parliament, the government faced such difficulties that it was decided instead to develop another version of the New Economic Structure - a system of planning by decree under the General Mobilization Law.\n\nSeigō Nakano described the compromise bill as suppressed by 'hypocritical bureaucrats and members of parliament serving liberal capitalists.' Due to the resulting direct confrontation between the government and big business, the political intervention Nakano had hoped for was ruled out, so he had little to offer the business community for their support, which, incidentally, has since waned."
 NW_JAP_aht.13.a: "This is the very last possible option for implementing economic reform."
 
 NW_JAP_aht.14.t: "Problems in Parliament"
 NW_JAP_aht.14.d: "The government has begun to face serious problems in parliament, related to attacks on the Imperial Rule Assistance Association as an unconstitutional body. One argument was that parliament was losing its independence in legislation and in conducting audits if all its members were part of a body headed by the prime minister. The absence of many 'renovationist' representatives in parliament severely hampered their ability to defend the Association from attacks in the lower house. Members of parliament decided to cut the budget of the Imperial Rule Assistance Association, while the zaibatsu cooperated with them by withholding interim funds on the basis of the alleged influence of 'reds' in the Association."
 NW_JAP_aht.14.a: "This is the beginning of the end for the Association project..."
 
 NW_JAP_aht.15.t: "Hiranuma's Statement"
 NW_JAP_aht.15.d.Hiranuma: "After criticism of the government began in parliament, Akira Kazami was replaced as Minister of Justice by General Yanagawa of the 'Imperial Way' faction. Almost immediately after this reshuffle, Hiranuma stated in parliament that the Imperial Rule Assistance Association has no political status, being merely a public organization, and promised to reorganize it accordingly. After this, the reduced budget was passed, which, however, led to the swift resignation of Seigō Nakano and Kingorō Hashimoto from their posts. Nakano told reporters that the Imperial Rule Assistance Association, despite its limited budget, 'was destroyed by obsolete forces, professional right-wingers, financial capitalists, and representatives of the fifth column.'"
 NW_JAP_aht.15.d: "After criticism of the government began in parliament, to control the situation, [JAP.GetLeader] brought Hiranuma into the cabinet as Minister of Home Affairs, while Akira Kazami was replaced as Minister of Justice by General Yanagawa of the 'Imperial Way' faction. Almost immediately after this reshuffle, Hiranuma stated in parliament that the Imperial Rule Assistance Association has no political status, being merely a public organization, and promised to reorganize it accordingly. After this, the reduced budget was passed, which, however, led to the swift resignation of Seigō Nakano and Kingorō Hashimoto from their posts. Nakano told reporters that the Imperial Rule Assistance Association, despite its limited budget, 'was destroyed by obsolete forces, professional right-wingers, financial capitalists, and representatives of the fifth column.'"
 NW_JAP_aht.15.a: "A harsh decision."
 
 NW_JAP_aht.16.t: "The Military's Attempt to Save the Association"
 NW_JAP_aht.16.d: "The military from the Tōseiha faction were dissatisfied with this turn of events, such as the rejection of economic reform projects. General Akira Mutō tried to preserve a political role for the Imperial Rule Assistance Association, but he failed. Hiranuma managed to lead a movement too powerful to overcome, aimed at eliminating all the reformist aspirations of the Association."
 NW_JAP_aht.16.a: "Does this prove that the civilian government is capable of subordinating the military?"
 
 NW_JAP_aht.17.t: "The Red Affair"
 NW_JAP_aht.17.d: "Today, the Kempeitai raided the Ministry of Commerce and Industry, resulting in the arrest of almost all the original authors of the new economic structure project. The secret police justify this operation on suspicion that these bureaucrats 'sympathize with socialist and communist ideas' and 'want to undermine the state system,' for which the incident has been dubbed the 'Red Affair' in the media. This is a severe blow to the reputation of the Imperial Rule Assistance Association and personally to Prince Konoe's circle. It is said that the Kempeitai operation was initiated at the behest of opponents of the plan's implementation, which gives hope that the arrested will be released quickly."
 NW_JAP_aht.17.a: "It seems the repressive machine is out of control."
 
 NW_JAP_aht.18.t: "Repressive Amendments to Laws"
 NW_JAP_aht.18.d: "On the initiative of the Privy Council, the House of Representatives has passed additional repressive amendments to the existing laws on the protection of the state system. This is a clear signal to those who wanted to use the Imperial Rule Assistance Association to reshape the system of state power for themselves. And it seems that this is the final stroke in its helplessness. It is believed that the main driver of these amendments was the chief opponent of the economic reform project – Kiichirō Hiranuma."
 NW_JAP_aht.18.a: "The traditional forces have won."
 
 NW_JAP_aht.19.t: "Reforming the Association"
 NW_JAP_aht.19.d: "The leadership of the Imperial Rule Assistance Association, headed by Arima Yoriyasu, has resigned due to the circumstances of its functioning, or rather, dysfunction. After this, Kiichirō Hiranuma was finally able to reform the Association in accordance with his plans, according to which it will be a 'public' rather than a 'political' organization: the political, planning, and parliamentary bureaus of the Association were abolished, and its prefectural branches were subordinated to the governors, that is, to the Ministry of Home Affairs."
 NW_JAP_aht.19.a: "The Association has finally become an auxiliary body of the bureaucracy."
 
 NW_JAP_aht.20.t: "Resignation of the Radicals"
 NW_JAP_aht.20.d: "Prime Minister [JAP.GetLeader] has dismissed the last supporters of a radical vision for the Imperial Rule Assistance Association from among the reformist bureaucrats: Naoki Hoshino and Kishi Nobusuke. Their place was taken by the influential industrialist Ogura Masatsune. However, to maintain bureaucratic balance, the main economic opponent of the project, Kobayashi Ichizō, also resigned. Now the Imperial Rule Assistance Association has finally turned into a facade and a shadow of its planned greatness – Japan continues to exist as if it never was."
 NW_JAP_aht.20.a: "The bigger they are, the harder they fall."
 
 NW_JAP_aht.21.t: "Failure of the New Economic Structure"
 NW_JAP_aht.21.d: "One of the main goals pursued by the military from the Tōseiha faction and some of the 'renovationists,' especially from Prince Konoe's circle, in creating the Imperial Rule Assistance Association was to carry out economic reform, involving the establishment or at least partial introduction of planned elements into the Japanese economy. It is now quite clear that they will not be able to achieve it. All repeated attempts at such proposals are defeated each time due to the overly strong influence of the zaibatsu, as well as traditionalist politicians and Japanists from parliament."
 NW_JAP_aht.21.a: "Time will tell if this idea has been buried for good or merely postponed again."
 
 NW_JAP_aht.22.t: "Long Disputes over the Association's Status"
 NW_JAP_aht.22.d: "During six meetings of the preparatory committee of the Imperial Rule Assistance Association, sharp disagreements arose over the status of the proposed organization, as the head of the Bureau of Military Affairs (the army's main agent of influence on policy) openly called for the creation of a single national party structure. However, it was decided that the proposed body would not be a political association, as this would imply the exclusion of some part of the nation, but merely a body 'supplementing the government.' Thus, the prime minister would be its chairman by virtue of his office."
 NW_JAP_aht.22.a: "The Association is struggling to gain ground."
 
 NW_JAP_aht.23.t: "A Difficult Decision on the Status of Governors"
 NW_JAP_aht.23.d: "Another hotly debated issue at the meetings of the Imperial Rule Assistance Association concerned whether the heads of the Association's branches should be prefectural governors, which is crucial to the nature of this body as either administrative or political. Adopting such an option would imply a duplication of the state and 'party' hierarchy, and thus a centralization of power, as governors would now become even less dependent in their actions. Also, and perhaps more importantly, the Ministry of Home Affairs would lose its position in the state. However, in the end, the supporters of such a radical project failed to push their idea through, and it was decided not to interfere with the existing power structure at the local level."
 NW_JAP_aht.23.a: "The purpose of the Association is fading before our eyes."
 
 NW_JAP_aht.24.t: "Nakano's Statement"
 NW_JAP_aht.24.d: "Today, Seigō Nakano published a statement in the newspapers, in which he declared that since all channels of political activity in the proper sense of the word have ceased to function, society is plunging into a vortex of intrigue, and that the Tōhōkai party will be revived to deal with this situation.\n\nThere are no legal obstacles to this, as the former parties disbanded in the struggle for participation in the new power structure, and not by coercion. Furthermore, since the Imperial Rule Assistance Association has now been declared non-political, another political party cannot be considered as competing with it."
 NW_JAP_aht.24.a: "A brilliant move. Is everything returning to how it was?"
 
 NW_JAP_aht.25.t: "The New Tōhōkai Platform"
 NW_JAP_aht.25.d: "Today, Seigō Nakano was officially declared president of the Tōhōkai party, whose new platform reads as follows:\n1. Declaring to those above the loyalty of the masses, we, in accordance with the provisions of the Constitution, will play a leading role in manifesting the imperial approach in politics.\n2. The pure spirit of Japan will be strengthened, strengthening Great East Asia and proclaiming justice throughout the world.\n3. An economic order of service to the whole people will be established, requiring labor and self-sacrifice from the entire nation, but promising honor and a livelihood.\n\nThe adopted rhetoric is clearly aimed at smoothing over some recent animosity, but since Nakano's political leverage has weakened as a result of the latest upheavals, he has taken a more reckless stance than ever, betting on the effectiveness of playing on two main sources of tension - the difficulties faced by small businesses under increased economic control and the hysteria caused by the rampant drive for war."
 NW_JAP_aht.25.a: "Nakano truly intends to revive parliamentary politics."
 
 NW_JAP_aht.26.t: "Hatoyama Revives the Liberal Party"
 NW_JAP_aht.26.d: "Ichirō Hatoyama, long dissatisfied with the changes taking place in the country, has planned to form a group of like-minded members to revive parliamentary politics. First, a 'Census Association' was formed, and today, with Hatoyama as the group's representative, 37 members of parliament have formed the Dōkōkai party. It has been joined by former representatives of different parties, both Seiyūkai and Minseitō, and even some deputies from the Shakai Taishūtō. Hatoyama's actions have received particularly important support from the 'father of constitutional politics,' Yukio Ozaki – the oldest member of parliament, who has been a deputy since 1891 and is the country's most steadfast and radical liberal politician. In the early 30s, he left all parties and became an independent deputy, as he was disillusioned with the parties of that time and their cooperation with the military. Now, it seems, he is ready to support the new movement."
 NW_JAP_aht.26.a: "This is now becoming alarming."
