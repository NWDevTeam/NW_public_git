Firstly, because the levying of this additional tax is effected under conditions of a constant improvement of the material position of the peasantry. Secondly, because the peasants have their own private husbandry, the income from which enables them to meet the additional tax, and in this they differ from the industrial workers, who have no private husbandry, but who nonetheless devote all their energies to the cause of industrialisation.
