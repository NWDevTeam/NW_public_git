Because of the crisis, most of the population was starving and in turn they held mass demonstrations with demands to provide assistance to the starving people. To preserve the stability of the government, we even had to take punitive measures. And although the worst is over, the consequences of this disaster are still being felt in the country."
    ALB_Failure_of_general_education:0 "Failure of the General Education Reform"
    ALB_Failure_of_general_education_desc:0 "In 1934, we carried out a reform of the entire existing education system. This reform included the nationalization of foreign schools that previously existed in the country; the introduction of compulsory primary education for children from four to fourteen years. It also provided for the expansion of secondary schools of various types, the creation of new technical, vocational, commercial and secondary schools, as well as the acceleration and expansion of teacher training.\n\nHowever, despite the broad scope of the reform, there are still many problems in the educational sphere: lack of budget funding, widespread illiteracy among peasants, lack of schools, educational literature, especially in Albanian, teachers and other personnel.\n\nWe must to do something, otherwise our graduates will continue to receive education in other countries..."
    ALB_Ineffective_land_reform:0 "Inefficient Agrarian Reform"
    ALB_Ineffective_land_reform_desc:0 "After Albania gained independence, we did not carry out any bourgeois agrarian reform. In fact, this means that our country still has a feudal system that has been established since the Ottoman Empire. Such a prolonged stagnation leads to the fact that the peasants become impoverished and emigrate to the cities, bringing down the economy in the villages.\n\nSuch a trend has reached such proportions that on April 13, 1930, a bill on land reform was approved and published in parliament. It contained almost 100 articles, provided for a large number of exceptions to the general rules for the confiscation of land surpluses. The reform was to be carried out within 15 years, and for each land ownership a special permission of the king was required. As a result, the agrarian reform remained on paper, and the law on it became a tool that Zog used to fight his personal opponents.\n\nToday, agriculture in Albania is in a catastrophic situation, which can provoke a mass famine. It is urgently necessary to solve this problem."

Its purpose would be to establish an Albanian Communist Party. The representatives of each group would make a report and present a self-critique of the work done by their group, and at the same time present a critique of the work done by the other groups. After each report, self-critical and critical, there was a general discussion, which became heated and degenerated into personal mutual accusations; the old group spirit, of course, did not fail to show in the discussions. At the end of the discussion the Yugoslavs, who drew attention to the revolutionary spirit and conscientiousness of the youth, took advantage of their sincerity and modesty to make the following observations: 1. The youth had not succeeded in agitating as widely among the masses as they should have done. 2. They have largely confined themselves to the formation of cadres and the translation of Marxist books. \n The leader of the youth group protested, although he admitted that, in part, these reproaches were valid. However, the Yugoslav Communists continued to press the youth group. Moreover, when the youth group asked for more detailed explanations of the orders and suggestions, the Stalinists became angry and scolded them as intellectuals. Whenever they could not find an explanation, the Stalinists used the term «intellectualism» as their main argument. The Albanian comrades asked sincerely and in good faith for explanations. They sought these explanations in order to find out more clearly what they were supposed to be doing, since in this way the problems were solved in a much more satisfactory way. Nevertheless, the comrades who found themselves in opposition agreed with all the decisions of the majority, although they were not always sure of their correctness. \n At the end of the discussion, Meladin asked the assembly of Albanian comrades to authorize him to appoint the Central Committee of the party.  Then, Meladin asked for the names of two or three candidates from each group, from which he would choose the Central Committee members. But he made it a condition that the candidates should not be chosen from among the former leaders of the groups, because their past disagreements could jeopardize the work of the party, especially if new disagreements arose within the Central Committee. This argument was also considered valid, and was taken into consideration. \n A few days later, the leaders of the Youth Group learned that the Central Committee had been formed from the leaders of the other two groups plus their rank-and-file members.  Forced to act solely in the interest of the party, the Young Party accepted this"

They were also joined by cooperating politicians such as Aziz Cami Lef Nosi, Fuat Dibra, Hasan Dosti and Bahri Omari.

They gave the most radical order - to secretly eliminate all the uncompromising revolutionaries. Anastas Lulo was murdered by members of his own battalion on charges of espionage and Trotskyism. Realizing that there was no more chance for the party to function, Sadik Premtja left the country. Realizing that they no longer had a counterweight within the party, the Yugoslavs used their influence to put their own man as chairman.

It clearly outlined the goals that they would eventually pursue in order to achieve Albania's accession to Yugoslavia.\nThe meeting was immediately shaken by a great deal of controversy, but the evidence gathered managed to calm down even the most skeptical, after which the Yugoslavs were booed and given the condition that they had to leave Albania within a few days, or else be executed as traitors.\nAlong with them, the Koci group, which had staked its claim on the Yugoslavs, lost much of its influence.

By May, the number of contributors to this campaign was increasing. Ismet Toto commented, «From many parts of Albania, especially from adult boys with brains, but also from old men who still fought for our country under Ottoman rule, we are receiving letters and support in favor of our campaign». In the following article, Ismet Toto appealed to the Albanians of the plains and mountains to unite in an ideal society that surpasses any other ideal, to strive for the goal, «the goal that sanctifies our being: to live and die for Albania!» Expressing his desire for a strong Albania, organized like other European countries and developed"

    NWalbania.71.d:0 "The question of Albanian unity is still unresolved, even after the overthrow of King Zogu's pro-Italian rule. Elders, muftis, and chiefs of distant tribes have proposed the return of conservative views and old customs.Brother Et'hem Toto, Ismet, who had long studied Kemalism and then turned to an enlightened dictatorship, proposed the establishment of this in the country, for only this could lead the nation to a bright future.\nLeaders of the rebels, they proposed that both sides should prepare concrete proposals and descriptions of their advantages within a month, after which a decision would be made."
    NWalbania.71.a:0 "This will be a momentous decision for all of Albania"
    
    NWalbania.72.t:0 "Ismet Toto's Speech"
    NWalbania.72.d:0 "Ismet Toto and his supporters spoke before the government asserting that only an Enlightened Dictatorship can awaken the passion in the hearts of the people for every Albanian to understand and boast of being an Albanian, not being illiterate, knowing why he lives, knowing his mission among society. According to Ismet Toto, «Dictatorship, only dictatorship will lift the Albanian crowds from the darkness of ignorance into the light of knowledge; because Dictatorship will sanctify the senses, will give health to the nation».\n«Peace can be maintained by force, but it does not become a nation. To form a nation, we need an IDEA that ignites people and forms collectives» Ismet Toto went on to say.\nCiting the Turkish National Assembly as an example, Ismet Toto states that «a large number of Turkish parliamentarians-kemalists it's scientists, writers, academics and journalists-who, in addition to their normal work in parliament, write and publish books, publish magazines and newspapers, run various cultural and social institutions, hold public conferences, teach in high schools, gymnasiums and universities, engage in art, theater and literature, and conduct many other activities to lift the country. The added value of this occupation was that they did all this work without remuneration!».\nSupporters of the Enlightened Dictatorship promoted that most of the deputies had to be professionals in various fields: the top 7-8 lawyers, 7-8 economists, small groups of engineers, agronomists, scientists and scholars, writers and journalists, and so on. When a project gets to parliament, it gets into the hands of competent people who know what they are saying, what they want, and what they are doing. Thus, the executive branch, the government, knows and understands the problems it seeks to solve. Consequently, it is from this parliament, Ismet Toto stressed, that the spirit of sacrifice to the nation and to the king must emanate. Albanian nationalism must be revived and strengthened so that it dominates all manifestations of Albanian life. With examples of work, self-sacrifice and unceasing effort to convince the people that the class they lead is striving for its own good and for its own elevation in the higher realms."

    NWalbania.73.t:0 "Speech by Conservative Policy supporters"
    NWalbania.73.d:0 "Opponents of the idea of the Enlightenment dictatorship argued: «Dictatorship is needed only by some nations, such as the Italians, Germans and Turks today, and in some critical historical epochs, and our nation does not need it. To tolerate dictatorship without overcoming a difficult historical moment is a mistake. A nation's most precious and sacred possession is freedom in the broadest sense of the word, and dictatorship is the oppression of that freedom». In opposing the ideas of Ismet Toto, the heads of the clans laid out the horrors of dictatorship to which such a policy would inevitably lead.\n\nThe communities of Albania were of a tribal and clan character, where the supremacy of the Kanun, the tribal laws, was respected in spite of their religious affiliation. Even the tribes that had converted to Catholicism respected this.\n\nMuftis insisted on the preservation of traditional values in everyday life, while chiefs advocated the introduction of tribal conscription, which was the case during the Ottoman Empire."
