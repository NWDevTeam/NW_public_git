 NW_marco_polo_bridge.12.d:0 "The Japanese army has stopped the escalation of conflict at Marco Polo Bridge. It seems that the seemingly inevitable war with Japan has managed to bypass us this time. It is true that we should not expect Japan to stop its attempts to take control of the lands of Northern China. Most surprisingly, a Japanese soldier on the grounds of Wanping Fortress was indeed found and turned over to the Japanese side."

 NW_marco_polo_bridge.13.d:0 "Despite general attempts to resolve the incident peacefully, Japanese artillery resumed shelling Wanping this morning, and their troops moved forward over the bridge.
