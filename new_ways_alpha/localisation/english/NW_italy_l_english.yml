The masses must be involved in the revolution, but they will not become anarchists until the revolution has already started. Anarchists must approach the masses and accept them as they are, without necessarily imposing any authoritarian pedagogical projects, but rather by adapting the anarchist ideology to their sensibilities.

Under capitalist production, the citizen was alienated from their labor, and confined to a certain type of activity. Now that individuals are interested in the results of their labor, they can no longer be limited to the former type of production, as was the case under the Mussolini government.\n\nThe bold experiment proposed is to abandon the capitalist principle of the division of labor to the greatest extent possible. The anarchist development of the economy is moving towards the re-employment of people in unlimited forms of production, mastering more and more activities.

On the other hand, opportunistic members of the bourgeoisie may try to use the new institution to pursue their own interests and participate in community life.
