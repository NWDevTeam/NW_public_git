    #EVENTS
    NWbhutan.1.t: "Death of the Je Khenpo"
    NWbhutan.1.desc: "Sad news came to the king's castle today. Choki Wangchuck, who was Je Khenpo of the Bhutan since 1931, has died. However, his successor, Ngawang Thinley, has already been chosen from among the most authoritative monks.\n\nIn the 17th century, Zhabdrung, the founder of Bhutan, established a dual system of government in the country, in which power was distributed between the secular king Druk Gyalpo and the spiritual leader Je Khenpo. However, after the establishment of the Wangchuck dynasty in the country, the influence of Je Khenpo was significantly reduced."
    NWbhutan.1.a: "He went to nirvana"
    
    NWbhutan.2.t: "Bhutan Requests Investments"
    NWbhutan.2.desc: "Today, a letter came from the King of Bhutan, Jigme Wangchuck, with a request to expand the payments that we make to the leadership of this Himalayan state on a monthly basis under the Treaty of Punakha. The king plans to use the funds received to reform his state, which, according to his plan, will also lead to an increase in the flow of Bhutanese goods to Britain."
    NWbhutan.2.a: "Our Government is skeptical about Bhutan's development prospects"
    NWbhutan.2.b: "We will send a small financial assistance"
    
    NWbhutan.3.t: "[From.GetAdjective] Refusal"

    NWbhutan.4.a: "Great"

    NWbhutan.5.desc: "Today from the king of Bhutan, Jigme Wangchuck we received a letter with a request to provide financial assistance in reforming the country. The ruler of the Himalayan kingdom also notes that the development of Bhutan's economy will also have a positive impact on trade between our countries."
    NWbhutan.5.a: "We are not interested in Bhutanese goods"
    NWbhutan.5.b: "We will provide a small assistance"
    NWbhutan.5.c: "We are ready to transfer substantial investments to the growing Bhutanese economy"
    
    NWbhutan.7.t: "Mask Dance"
    NWbhutan.7.desc: "Paro penlop Tsering Penjor has always had a flair for entertainment. In particular, he is very fond of cinema, especially Charlie Chaplin films. But his greatest amusement is organising a colourful mask dance, which he makes his warriors perform while he and his servants beat drums."
    NWbhutan.7.a: "That's a pretty inappropriate thing for warriors to do..."
    
    NWbhutan.8.t: "Rift among the Penlops"
    NWbhutan.8.desc: "Although the king's efforts to centralise the state displeased some penlops, for a long time the monarch was able to maintain stability in the country. However, the attempt to limit the influence of the Paro Penlop Tshering Penjor, perceived by him as a show of ingratitude for his loyalty and honest service, intensified the conspiratorial activities of the disgruntled feudal lords. Some of the largest garrisons are in the border town of Phuentsholing and Chukha Dzong, through which the only road from India to Bhutan passes. The main threat to the king's authority comes from the north-western regions and we can weaken the military presence in the south, but weakening border control could facilitate the infiltration of exiled opposition forces into Bhutan."
    NWbhutan.8.a: "We need to assemble all available forces"
    NWbhutan.8.b: "Border controls should not be weakened"
    
    NWbhutan.9.t: "The War against the Tyranny of Jigme Wangchuck"
    NWbhutan.9.desc: "The disgruntled penlops in the west have finally decided to openly oppose Jigme Wangchuck's ‘tyranny’, but the monarch is ready for such a development.\n\nIt may be best for the forces loyal to the king to position themselves in the battle-scarred Thimphu Valley, where Ugyen Wangchuck won a decisive victory in the Battle of Bhutan 50 years ago. This will allow Jigme Wangchuck to block the path to Punakha and continue to receive reinforcements, which are still coming from all over the country.\n\nHowever, the rebels still don't have a single leader and we can move on and try to take Paro and capture Tshering Penjor, which in theory could disorganise the rebels. However, this plan is quite risky. Once we enter the Paro Valley, our troops could be attacked from the rear by the Dobji Dzong, so we must take care to cover the rear."
    NWbhutan.9.a: "It's not worth the risk"
    NWbhutan.9.b: "Attack Paro"
    
    NWbhutan.10.t: "Tong Uprising"
    NWbhutan.10.desc: "News had reached us that a major peasant uprising had begun in the east, led by Khengpa of Zhemgang, who were dissatisfied with the taxation oppression that had been steadily increasing since the unification of the country. This rebellion would not be a significant problem for us if our main combat troops were not busy suppressing the rebellion in the west.\n\nThe penlops in the King's camp insist that the monarch protect their lands and order the troops to fight the peasants. However, we have few forces in the region that we can call upon to put down the uprising. Perhaps we should concentrate on taking as many loyal forces as possible to Trongsa Dzong, the former capital of the Wangchuck family. By doing so we would block the only road by which the rebels could penetrate into the more populated western Bhutan, but in that case most of the dzongs in the east would be overrun by peasants."
    NWbhutan.10.a: "The rebels will be defeated"
    NWbhutan.10.b: "Concentrate forces at Trongsa"
    
    NWbhutan.11.t: "Victory in Thimphu"
    NWbhutan.11.desc: "Unaware of the chaos in the east, the rebel penlops felt they had no choice but to immediately attack Jigme Wangchuck's forces in the Thimphu valley before the king could mobilise more forces from the interior of Bhutan. Despite some numerical superiority, the poorly organised and armed penlops troops were unable to defeat the king's forces and were forced to retreat with heavy losses."
    NWbhutan.11.a: "Long live the King!"
    
    NWbhutan.12.t: "Siege of Rinpung"
    NWbhutan.12.desc: "The appearance of the king's troops in the Paro Valley came as a surprise to Tshering Penjor, whose troops had not had time to properly prepare for defence. However, the king's troops did not succeed in capturing Rinpung Dzong and capturing Penjor."
    NWbhutan.12.a: "We must act as quickly as possible"
    
    NWbhutan.13.t: "Zhabdrung arrives in Bhutan"
    NWbhutan.13.desc: "Bhutan as a state was founded in the 17th century by the Buddhist monk Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyal. After Zhabdrung's death in 1651, the Bhutanese authorities successfully concealed this fact for another 54 years. But in the end, the country was plunged into two centuries of civil war, virtually ceasing to exist, until eventually Ugyen Wangchuck founded the modern Kingdom of Bhutan.\n\nNevertheless, formally the ruler of Bhutan is still supposed to be a spiritual leader who is the reincarnation of Zhabdrung. So in 1931, Zhabdrung Jigme Dorji tried to challenge Jigme Wangchuck's leadership but was assassinated. At the same time Jigme Tendzin, the "speech incarnation" of Zhabdrung, was forced to leave the country.\n\nOn the backdrop of the escalating conflict between the penlops and the king, and in view of the relaxation of the previously extremely strict border controls, Jigme Tendzin re-entered the country and took refuge with Jemip Wangdi, the Penlop of Dobji. "
    NWbhutan.13.a: "The situation is escalating"
    
    NWbhutan.14.t: "Jigme's Defeat"
    NWbhutan.14.desc: "Shortly after the failed assault on Rinpung, the king's camp received disturbing news of the surrender of the garrison left at Tachog Monastery to protect the passage to the Paro Valley. As a result, Jigme Wangchuck's army was trapped between the two rebel armies. The royal troops were defeated before the penlops captured Thimphu and Punkha without resistance.\n\nIn the capital, Jemip Wangdi, the Dobji Penlop, called for the reincarnation of Zhabdrung in the person of Jigme Tendzin to be restored to power, while he himself took over as Druk Desi, the administrative administrator and de facto leader."
    NWbhutan.14.a: "Long live the Zhabdrung!"
    
    NWbhutan.15.t: "Jigme's Defeat"
    NWbhutan.15.desc: "Shortly after the failed assault on Rinpung, the king's camp received disturbing news of the surrender of the garrison left at Tachog Monastery to protect the passage to the Paro Valley. As a result, Jigme Wangchuck's army was trapped between the two rebel armies. The royal troops were defeated before the penlops captured Thimphu and Punkha without resistance. After that, Tshering Penjor was proclaimed the new king of Bhutan."
    NWbhutan.15.a: "Long live the King!"
    
    NWbhutan.16.t: "Uprising in Dagana"
    NWbhutan.16.desc: "No sooner had the situation in the north normalised than the government received news of a rebellion in the south. Garjaman Gurung, an influential mandal from Dagana, enlisted the support of the Jai Gorkha movement to revolt against the repressive feudal laws."
    NWbhutan.16.a: "They don't pose a significant threat"
    
    NWbhutan.17.t: "Rebel Alliance"
    NWbhutan.17.desc: "According to recent reports from our spies, the rebels of Gurung and Khengpa, realising the low level of training of their troops, have held talks to join forces against the Central Government.\n\nHowever, among the troops of Garjaman Gurung are many soldiers hired by him for his own money, disgruntled small landowners with their men, and townspeople. We can try to cause discord in the southern rebel army by bribery and promises of privileges. However, this would be a great blow to our treasury and it might be more rational to bet on fighting alone, especially if the Trongsa Dzong holds and the rebels from the east do not break through to the west."
    NWbhutan.17.a: "Try to cause discord among the rebels"
    NWbhutan.17.b: "We will defeat them on the battlefield"
    
    NWbhutan.18.t: "Rebel Defeat"
    NWbhutan.18.desc: "A general battle between our troops and the rebels of Garjaman Gurung took place today in Wangdue Phodrang district. Despite the presence of some professional warriors, the rebels were unable to give a befitting reply to our army.\n\nEarlier, the Khengpa's rebels in the east of the country had tried to link up with Gurung's troops, but after encountering our pre-fortified Trongsa Dzong and suffering heavy losses, they were forced to abandon their plans to enter the western part of the country.\n\nAfter such heavy defeats, the rebel forces have begun to disintegrate. We should have no trouble finishing off the remaining rebels."
    NWbhutan.18.a: "A great victory!"
    
    NWbhutan.19.t: "Rebel Defeat"
    NWbhutan.19.desc: "A general battle between our troops and the rebels of Garjaman Gurung took place today in Wangdue Phodrang district.\n\nAlthough the rebels had earlier succeeded in capturing the Trongsa Dzong, which had been left almost garrisonless, and united their forces, many of Garjaman Gurung's men chose to leave his army due to bribes and promises of concessions from the government. Against this background, the leadership dispute between Gurung and Khengpa also began.\n\nThe rebels failed to give a honourable fight to our army and were defeated and scattered around."
    NWbhutan.19.a: "A great victory!"
    
    NWbhutan.20.t: "Rebel Victory"
    NWbhutan.20.desc: "The decision to gather all the troops of eastern Bhutan to attempt to suppress the peasant rebellion led by Khenpa proved fatal to the central government. The assembled army failed to defeat the rebels. The rebels took advantage of the weakened garrison of Trongsa-dzong to capture it and unite their armies.\n\nIn the battle that broke out in the area of Wangdue Phodrang, the government troops, weakened by the previous battles, despite being better prepared, were unable to resist the numerically superior enemy.\n\nAfter occupying the capital, Garjaman Gurung, with his large fortune, popularity among the citizens, and disciplined and trained troops, was able to have his Druk Desi of Bhutan proclaimed."
    NWbhutan.20.a: "This is the beginning of a new era in Bhutan's history"
    
    NWbhutan.21.t: "New Army"
    NWbhutan.21.desc: "Not everyone in our country has accepted the fall of the Wangchuck dynasty. In the current situation, the military might of the government is the only reliable guarantee for the establishment of final peace. We cannot rely on the militia alone as before, especially since only a small part of the militia has taken part in the recent civil war and we do not know which troops are loyal to us and which are not. Therefore, we must create a regular army in parallel with the militia."
    NWbhutan.21.a: "It would be a sensible decision"
    NWbhutan.21.b: "Maintaining a regular army is too expensive"
    
    NWbhutan.22.t: "New Je Khenpo"
    NWbhutan.22.desc: "According to Cho-sid-nyi, the dual system of government that was established by Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyal at the founding of Bhutan, the organs of state power should be divided between a religious branch headed by Je Khenpo and a civil administration headed by Druk Desi. The heads of both branches should report to Zhabdrung, the reincarnation of Ngawang Namgyal.\n\nWith the rise to power of the Wangchuck dynasty at the beginning of this century, the dual system was virtually abolished and all power fell into the hands of the king, who bears the title of Druk Gyalpo. However, the country is now once again, at least nominally, under the rule of Zhabdrung, while Jemip Wangdi has assumed the newly created title of Druk Desi.\n\nNow we need to decide who will head the spiritual branch of government. We can keep the old Je Khenpo or appoint a new one."
    NWbhutan.22.a: "Samten Jamtsho will become the new Je Khenpo"
    NWbhutan.22.b: "Ngawang Thinley is the best candidate"
    NWbhutan.22.c: "Current Je Khenpo is loyal enough"
    
    NWbhutan.23.t: "Search results"
    NWbhutan.23.desc: "Our monks conducted a thorough search for the reincarnation of Zhabdrung's body in [?ROOT.BHU_state_for_loc.GetName]. After a divination ritual, several boys were selected who could supposedly be incarnations of Shabdrung, but none of them could recall details of their past lives or recite the sacred text. However, the expedition was merely to prove that there was no one in [?ROOT.BHU_state_for_loc.GetName] who could claim the title of Ku tulku."
    NWbhutan.23.a: "Maybe the real Zhabdrung's body incarnation is near us...?"
    
    NWbhutan.27.t: "[GetNewsHeadline]Zhabdrung's Reincarnation Return"
    NWbhutan.27.d: "The Wangchuck dynasty came to power in Bhutan in 1907, victorious in more than two centuries of civil war. The only problem in establishing the legitimacy of the new dynastic monarchy was that, according to tradition, supreme power in the country could only belong to the recognised reincarnation of Zhabdrung, the founder of Bhutan.\n\nThis fact was exploited by the feudal lords who were dissatisfied with the king's rule. They revolted and overthrew the Wangchuck dynasty. As a result, the supreme ruler of the country was proclaimed Jigme Tendzin, the recognised ‘speech incarnation’ of Zhabdrung, but the real power fell into the hands of the feudal lords."
    NWbhutan.27.a: "Long live the Zhabdrung!"
    NWbhutan.27.b: "Himalayan politics are quite bizarre..."

    BHU_3_incarnations_shabdrung_category: "Zhabdrung's three incarnations"
    BHU_3_incarnations_shabdrung_desc_tt: "After Zhabdrung's death in 1651, the Bhutanese authorities successfully concealed this fact for another 54 years. But in the end, the country was still faced with an inheritance crisis. In order to neutralise the power of future incarnations, Je Khenpo, Druk Desi and the penlops conspired to recognise not just one person, but three separate personalities - the body incarnation, the mind incarnation and the speech incarnation of Zhabdrung.\n\nAfter the overthrow of the Wangchuck dynasty, the new authorities announced the restoration of Zhabdrung's power in the person of his speech incarnation, Jigme Tendzin. Perhaps we should get our leader recognized as all three incarnations of Zhabdrung and put an end to 250 years of collusion."

    BHU_buddha_figurines_desc: "After the unification of Bhutan, to atone for the effects of the long wars and to properly conduct funeral rites, Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyal Zhabdrung made 15,000,000 miniature statues of 115 different kinds of Buddhas. He personally worked late into the night on this with several monks. To prove his chosenness, Jigme Tendzin must at least partially (and not without government help) repeat Zhabdrung's feat."
