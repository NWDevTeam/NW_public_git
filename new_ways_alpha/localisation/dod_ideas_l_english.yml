 HUN_treaty_of_triannon_desc:0 "The Treaty of Trianon is very similar to the Treaty of Versailles: it shackles our defenses, preventing rearmament. Our main task should be either to amend it or to cancel it completely. To achieve this, we will need to get closer to the Lesser Entente and put forward a draft of the Bled agreement, or refuse to comply with the terms of the agreement. The second option is highly likely to be considered aggressive and may cause a strong reaction from the world powers."
