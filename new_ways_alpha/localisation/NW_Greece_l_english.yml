 GRE_third_hellenic_civilization_desc:0 "Ancient Greece was the first Hellenic civilization. Byzantium is the second. Now, when we are going to return to our former greatness, we can talk about the formation of a new, third Hellenic civilization."
 GRE_national_youth_organization_desc:0 "Greece clearly does not have enough conscripts to compete with most of its neighboring countries.

 GRE_suspend_the_work_of_parliament_desc:0 "Under the current Communist threat, we have no right to leave a functioning Parliament in the country.

 GRE_saving_neutrality_desc:0 "The reality is that in the current situation, Greece is one of the weakest countries in Europe.

 GRE_concessions_for_italy_desc:0 "Perhaps if we offer Italy a small part of our territories, they will agree to accept us into their Alliance. In this case, we will be able to avoid a possible war with it, and we will also be able to participate in the future redistribution of the world on the side of a strong state."
 GRE_entry_to_the_axis_desc:0 "It is becoming increasingly clear that the third Reich is the future of humanity. We must become an ally of Germany if we want to maintain our sovereignty in the future."
 GRE_strengthening_nationalist_rhetoric_desc:0 "Nationalism will help unite the Greeks, which will have a positive impact on the country's preparation for a future war, so we need to strengthen the propaganda of nationalism in our state."

 GRE_write_off_of_farm_debt_desc:0 "Another drag on the economy is that most Greek farmers are up to their ears in debt and cannot develop normally. Perhaps if we write off their debts, it will be more profitable in the long run than requiring impoverished farmers to return their borrowed funds."

 GRE_greek_armed_forces:0 "Greek Armed Forces"

 GRE_in_favor_of_aircraft_for_air_force_desc:0 "Our finances are not up to scratch. As a result, the ability of aviation to start re-equipping with modern aircraft at the expense of the state budget is limited, so we need to start a new campaign to raise funds to support aviation, some of which we will use for other needs."

 GRE_bidding_for_sky_desc:0 "We need to decide on the choice of a standard for our aviation, otherwise the problems associated with the diversity of our aviation will not end. We will immediately send a request for bidding to our partners."
 GRE_german_air_force:0 "German Air Forces"
 GRE_german_air_force_desc:0 "By purchasing licenses from Germany, we will get excellent samples of aircraft, but do not forget that everything has its price. This country refuses to clear our debts, so we will have to pay in gold, which we already do not have in abundance."

As a result, the ability of aviation to start re-equipping with modern aircraft at the expense of the state budget is limited, so we need to start a new campaign to raise funds to support aviation. To do this, we use the program proposed by Minister Ikonomakos, according to which we will play on the patriotism and vanity of our subjects, publishing the amounts and names of donors in the Newspapers. This money will cover part of the cost of producing their own aircraft."
 GRE_aviation_fund:0 "Aviation Fund"
 GRE_aviation_fund_desc:0 "A national aviation Foundation will be established, where the names of every Greek who once invested in the development of aviation will be archived. This will also raise our air force's profile, increasing the number of young people interested in the service."
