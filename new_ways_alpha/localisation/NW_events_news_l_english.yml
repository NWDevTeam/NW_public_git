 trworldnews.145.desc:0 "A couple of months ago, a rebellion led by Sheikhs Harami and Falati began in the province of al-Batinah in the Sultanate of Muscat. Despite the relatively small number of rebels, Sultan Said bin Taimur did not have time to assemble enough troops to repel the rebels. As a result, after a brief but fierce battle, the rebels succeeded in capturing Muscat. The rebels looted the city and made nearby city Muttrah their new capital.\nSheikh Harami has proclaimed a new era in the country's history but its eastern provinces are still under the control of forces loyal to the Sultan.\nThere has been no international reaction to the events in Muscat, but since the country is part of the British sphere of influence, London will almost certainly intervene in the conflict."
